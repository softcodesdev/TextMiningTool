The design of the logo on the cover is adapted from a Christian tombstone in the catacombs of
Domitilla in Rome, which dates from the end of the third century. This pastoral image, of pagan
origin, was used by Christians to symbolize the rest and the happiness that the soul of the departed
finds in eternal life. This image also suggests certain characteristic aspects of this Catechism: Christ,
the Good Shepherd who leads and protects his faithful (the lamb) by his authority (the staffi, draws
them by the melodious symphony of the truth (the panpipes), and makes them lie down in the shade
of the tree of life, his redeeming Cross which opens paradise.

Apostolic Letter Laetamur Ma gnopere

Apostolic Constitution Fidei Depositum of October 11, 1992, which,
on the 30 th anniversa ry of the opening of the Second Va ti can
Council, accompanied the publica tion of the first, French-language
text of the Catechism.
We have all been able to note with pleasure the broa d
positive reception and wide dissem inati on of the Catechism in these
years, especia lly in the particula r Churches, which have ha d it
translated into their respective languages, thus ma king i t as a cces­
sible as possible to the various linguistic communities of the world .
This fa ct confirms how fitting wa s the request submitted to me in
1985 by the Extra ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops tha t
a catechism or compendium of all Ca tholi c doctrine rega rding faith
and morals be com posed .
Drawn up by the specia l Comm ission of Ca rdinals and
Bishops established in 1986, the Catechism was approved and
promulgated by me in the a forementioned Apostolic Constitu tion,
which today retains all its va lidity a nd timeliness, and finds its
definitive achievement in this La tin typical edition.
Th is edition wa s prepa red by an In terdicasteria l Commis­
sion which I a ppointed f or this purpose in 1993. Presided over by
Ca rdinal Joseph Ra tz inger, this Commission worked diligently to
fulfill the manda te it received . It devoted pa rticula r a ttention to a
study of the ma ny suggested changes to the contents of the text,
which in these yea rs ha d come f rom a round the world and from
various pa rts of the ecclesia l community .
I n this regard one can certa inly understand tha t such a
remarkable number of suggested im provements shows the ex­
traord ina ry interest tha t the Catechism has ra ised throughout the
world, even among non-Ch ristians, and conf irm s its purpose of
being presented as a full, complete exposition of Ca tholic doctrine,
enabli ng everyone to know wha t the Chu rch professes, celebra tes,
lives, and prays in her da ily life. At the sa me time it draws a t tention
to the ea ger desire of all to ma ke their contribution so tha t the
Christian fa ith, whose essential and necessa ry elements a re sum­
ma rized in the Catechism, can be presented to the people of our day
in the most su itable way possible. Furthermore, this collabora tion
of the var ious members of the Church will once aga in a chi eve wha t
I w rote in the Apostolic Cons titu tion Fidei Depositum: "The ha r­
mony of so many voices tru ly expresses wha t could be cal led the
'symphony ' of the fa ith" (no. 2 ) .
For these reasons too, the Commission seriously consid­
ered the suggesti ons offered, ca refully exa mined them a t va riou s
levels and submitted its conclu si ons for my ap prova l . These
conclusions, insofa r as they allow for a b e tter expression of the

Catechism's contents regarding the deposit of the Catholic faith, or
enable certain truths of this faith to be formulated in a way more
suited to the requirements of contemporary catechetical instruc­
tion, have been approved by me and thus have been incorporated
into this Latin typical edition. Therefore it faithfully repeats the

I officially presented to the Church and to
the world in December 1992.
doctrinal content which

With today's promulgation of the Latin typical edition,
therefore, the task of composing the Catechism, begun in

1986, is

brought to a close and the desire of the aforementioned Extraordi­
nary Synod of Bishops is happily fulfilled. The Church now has at
her disposal this new, authoritative exposition of the one and
perennial apostolic faith, and it will serve as a "valid and legitimate
instrument for ecclesial communion" and as a "sure norm for
teaching the faith/' as well as a "sure and authentic reference text"
for preparing local catechisms

(d.

Apostolic Constitution Fidei

Depositum, no. 4) .
Catechesis will find in this genuine, systematic presenta­
tion of the faith and of Catholic doctrine a totally reliable way to
present, with renewed fervor, each and every part of the Christian
message to the people of our time. This text will provide every
catechist with sound help for communicating the one, perennial
deposit of faith within the local Church, while seeking, with the
help of the Holy Spirit, to link the wondrous unity of the Christian
mystery with the varied needs and conditions of those to whom
this message is addressed. All catechetical activity will be able to
experience a new, widespread impetus among the People of God,
if it can properly use and appreciate this post-conciliar Catechism.
All this seems even more important today with the ap­
proach of the third millennium. For an extraordinary commitment
to evangelization is urgently needed so that everyone can know
and receive the Gospel message and thus grow "to the measure of
the stature of the fullness of Christ" (Eph 4:13).

I therefore strongly urge my Venerable Brothers in the

Episcopate, for whom the Catechism is primarily intended, to take
the excellent opportunity afforded by the promulgation of this
Latin edition to intensify their efforts to disseminate the text more
widely and to ensure that it is well received as an outstanding gift
for the communities entrusted to them, which will thus be able to
rediscover the inexhaustible riches of the faith.
Through the harmonious and complementary efforts of all
the ranks of the People of God, may this Catechism be known and
shared by everyone, so that the unity in faith whose supreme model

XVI

Apostolic Letter Laetamur Magnopere

and origin is found in the Unity of the Trinity may be strengthened
and extended to the ends of the earth.
To Mary, Mother of Christ, whose Assump tion body and
soul into heaven we celebrate today, I entrust these wishes so that
they may be brought to fulfillment for the spiritual good of all
humanity.
From Castel Gandolfo, August 15, 1997 , the nineteenth
year of the Pontificate.

APOSTOLIC
CONSTITUTION
FIDEI DEPOSITUM
ON THE PUBLICATION OF THE
CATECHISM OF THE

CATHOLIC CHURCH
PREPARED FOLLOWING
THE SECOND VATICAN
ECUMENICAL COUNCIL
JOHN PAUL, BISHOP
SERVANT OF THE SERVANTS OF GOD
FOR EVERLASTING MEMORY

To my Venerable Brothers the Cardinals, Patriarchs, Archbishops,
Bishops, Priests, Deacons, and to all the People of God.
GUARDING 1HE DEPOSIT OF FAITH Is 1HE MISSION WHICH

THE LORD ENTRUSTED TO HIS CHURCH, and which she fulfills

in

every age. The Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, which was
opened 30 years ago by my predecessor Pope John

XXIII, of happy

2

Apostolic Constitution Fidei Depositum

memory, had as its intention and purpose to highlight the Church's
apostolic and pastoral mission and by making the truth of the
Gospel shine forth to lead all people to seek and receive Christ's
love which surpasses all knowledge (d. Eph 3:19).
The principal task entrusted to the Council by Pope John
XXIII was to guard and present better the precious deposit of
Christian doctrine in order to make it more accessible to the Chris­
tian faithful and to all people of good will. For this reason the
Council was not first of all to condemn the errors of the time, but
above all to strive cahnly to show the strength and beauty of the
doctrine of the faith. "Illumined by the light of this Council," the
Pope said, "the Church . . . will become greater in spiritual riches
and gaining the strength of new energies therefrom, she will look
to the future without fear. . . . Our duty is to dedicate ourselves
with an earnest will and without fear to that work which our era
demands of us, thus pursuing the path which the Church has
followed for 20 centuries." 1
With the help of God, the Council Fathers in four years of
work were able to produce a considerable number of doctrinal
statements and pastoral norms which were presented to the whole
Church. There the Pastors and Christian faithful find directives for
that "renewal of thought, action, practices, and moral virtue, of joy
and hope, which was the very purpose of the Counci1."2
After its conclusion, the Council did not cease to inspire
the Church's life. In 1985 I was able to assert, "For me, then-who
had the special grace of participating in it and actively collaborat­
ing in its development-Vatican II has always been, and especially
during these years of my Pontificate, the constant reference point
of my every pastoral action, in the conscious commitment to im­
plement its directives concretely and faithfully at the level of each
Church and the whole Church." 3
In this spirit, on January 25, 1985, I convoked an extraor­
dinary assembly of the Synod of Bishops for the 20th anniversary
of the close of the Council. The purpose of this assembly was to
celebrate the graces and spiritual fruits of Vatican II, to study its
teaching in greater depth in order that all the Christian faithful
might better adhere to it and to promote knowledge and applica­
tion of it.

On that occasion the Synod Fathers stated: "Very many
have expressed the desire that a catechism or compendium of all
catholic doctrine regarding both faith and morals be composed,
that it might be, as it were, a point of reference for the catechisms
or compendiums that are prepared in various regions. The presen­
tation of doctrine must be biblical and liturgical. It must be sound
doctrine suited to the present life of Christians." 4 After the Synod
ended, I made this desire my own, considering it as " fully respond­
ing to a real need of the universal Church and of the particular
Churches." 5
For this reason we thank the Lord wholeheartedly on this
day when we can offer the entire Church this "reference text"
entitled the Catechism of the Catholic Church for a catechesis renewed
at the living sources of the faith!
Following the renewal of the Liturgy and the new codifi­
cation of the canon law of the Latin Church and that of the Oriental
Catholic Churches, this catechism will make a very important
contribution to that work of renewing the whole life of the Church,
as desired and begun by the Second Vatican Council.
1.

The Process and Spirit of Drafting the Text

The Catechism of the Catholic Church is the result of very
extensive collaboration; it was prepared over six years of intense
work done in a spirit of complete openness and fervent zeal.
In 1986, I entrusted a commission of twelve Cardinals and
Bishops, chaired by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, with the task of
preparing a draft of the catechism requested by the Synod Fathers.
An editorial committee of seven diocesan Bishops, experts in the­
ology and catechesis, assisted the commission in its work.
The commission, charged with giving directives and with
overseeing the course of the work, attentively followed all the
stages in editing the nine subsequent drafts. The editorial commit­
tee, for its part, assumed responsibility for writing the text, making
the emendations requested by the commission and examining the
observations of numerous theologians, exegetes and catechists,
and, above all, of the Bishops of the whole world, in order to
produce a better text. In the committee various opinions were
compared with great profit, and thus a richer text has resulted
whose unity and coherence are assured.

The project was the object of extensive consultation among
all Catholic Bishops, their Episcopal Conferences or Synods, and
of theological and catechetical institutes. As a whole, it received a
broadly favorable acceptance on the part of the Episcopate. It can
be said that this Catechism is the result of the collaboration of the
whole Episcopate of the Catholic Church, who generously ac­
cepted my invitation to share responsibility for an enterprise which
directly concerns the life of the Church. This response elicits in me
a deep feeling of joy, because the harmony of so many voices truly
expresses what could be called the "symphony" of the faith. The
achievement of this Catechism thus reflects the collegial nature of
the Episcopate; it testifies to the Church's catholicity.
2.

Arrangement of the Material

A catechism should faithfully and systematically present
the teaching of Sacred Scripture, the living Tradition in the Church
and the authentic Magisterium, as well as the spiritual heritage of
the Fathers, Doctors, and saints of the Church, to allow for a better
knowledge of the Christian mystery and for enlivening the faith of
the People of God. It should take into account the doctrinal state­
ments which down the centuries the Holy Spirit has intimated to
his Church. It should also help to illumine with the light of faith
the new situations and problems which had not yet emerged in the
past.
This catechism will thus contain both the new and the old
(d. Mt 13 :52), because the faith is always the same yet the source
of ever new light.
To respond to this twofold demand, the Catechism of the
Catholic Church on the one hand repeats the " old," traditional order
already followed by the Catechism of St. Pius V, arranging the
material in four parts: the Creed, the Sacred Liturgy, with pride of
place given to the sacraments, the Christian way of life, explained
beginning with the Ten commandments, and finally, Christian
prayer. At the same time, however, the contents are often presented
in a "new" way in order to respond to the questions of our age.
The four parts are related one to another: the Christian
mystery is the object of faith (first part); it is celebrated and com­
municated in liturgical actions (second part); it is present to en­
lighten and sustain the children of God in their actions (third part);
it is the basis for our prayer, the privileged expression of which is
the Our Father, and it represents the object of our supplication, our
praise and our intercession (fourth part) .

The Liturgy itself is prayer; the confession of faith finds its
proper place in the celebration of worship. Grace, the fruit of the
sacraments, is the irreplaceable condition for Christian living, just
as participation in the Church's Liturgy requires faith. If faith is not
expressed in works, it is dead (d. Jas 2:14-16) and cannot bear fruit
unto eternal life.
In reading the Catechism of the Catholic Church we can
perceive the wonderful unity of the mystery of God, his saving will,
as well as the central place of Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son
of God, sent by the Father, made man in the womb of the Blessed
Virgin Mary by the power of the Holy Spirit, to be our Savior.
Having died and risen, Christ is always present in his Church,
especially in the sacraments; he is the source of our faith, the model
of Christian conduct, and the Teacher of our prayer.

The Doctrinal Value of the Text

The Catechism of the Catholic Church, which I approved June
25th last and the publication of which I today order by virtue of my
Apostolic Authority, is a statement of the Church's faith and of
catholic doctrine, attested to or illumined by Sacred Scripture, the
Apostolic Tradition, and the Church's Magisterium. I declare it to
be a sure norm for teaching the faith and thus a valid and legitimate
instrument for ecclesial communion. May it serve the renewal to
which the Holy Spirit ceaselessly calls the Church of God, the Body
of Christ, on her pilgrimage to the undiminished light of the
Kingdom!
The approval and publication of the Catechism of the Catho­
lic Church represent a service which the Successor of Peter wishes
to offer to the Holy Catholic Church, to all the particular Churches
in peace and communion with the Apostolic See: the service, that
is, of supporting and confirming the faith of all the Lord Jesus'
disciples (cf. Lk 22:32), as well as of strengthening the bonds of
unity in the same apostolic faith.
Therefore, I ask all the Church's Pastors and the Christian
faithful to receive this catechism in a spirit of communion and to
use it assiduously in fulfilling their mission of proclaiming the faith
and calling people to the Gospel life. This catechism is given to
them that it may be a sure and authentic reference text for teaching
catholic doctrine and particularly for preparing local catechisms.
It is also offered to all the faithful who wish to deepen their
knowledge of the unfathomable riches of salvation (cf. Eph 3:8). It
is meant to support ecumenical efforts that are moved by the holy
desire for the unity of all Christians, showing carefully the content

lastly, is offered to every individual who asks us

to give an account of the hope that is in us

(d. 1 Pet 3:15) and who

wants to know what the Catholic Church believes.
This catechism is not intended to replace the local cate­
chisms duly approved by the ecclesiastical authorities, the dioce­
san Bishops and the Episcopal Conferences, especially if they have
been approved by. the Apostolic See. It is meant to encourage and
assist in the writing of new local catechisms, which take into
account various situations and cultures, while carefully preserving
the unity of faith and fidelity to catholic doctrine.

THE LIFE OF MAN - To KN O W AND LOVE Goo

1

God, infinitely perfect and blessed in himself, in a plan of

sheer goodness freely created man to make him share in his own

blessed life. For this reason, at every time and in every place, God

draws close to man. He calls man to seek him, to know him, to love
him with all his strength. He calls together all men, scattered and
divided by sin, into the unity of his family, the Church. To accom­
plish this, when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son as
Redeemer and Savior.

In his Son and through him, he invites men

to become, in the Holy Spirit, his adopted children and thus heirs
of his blessed life.

2

So that this call should resound throughout the world,

Christ sent forth the apostles he had chosen, commissioning them
to proclaim the gospel: "Go therefore and make disciples of all
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have
commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the
age. " 4 Strengthened by this mission, the apostles "went forth and
preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and
confirmed the message by the signs that attended it. " 5

3

Those who with God's help have welcomed Christ's call

and freely responded to it are urged on by love of Christ to
proclaim the Good News everywhere in the world. This treasure,
received from the apostles, has been faithfully guarded by their
successors. All Christ's faithful are called to hand it on from gen-

eration to generation, by professing the faith, by living it in frater­
nal sharing, and by celebrating it in liturgy and prayer.6
II.

HANDING ON THE FAITH: CATECHESIS

Quite early on, the name catechesis was given to the totality
4
of the Church's efforts to make disciples, to help men believe that
Jesus is the Son of God so that believing they might have life in his
name, and to educate and instruct them in this life, thus building
up the body of Christ?
"Catechesis is an education in the faith of children, young
5
people, and adults which includes especially the teaching of Chris­
tian doctrine imparted, generally speaking, in an organic and
systematic way, with a view to initiating the hearers into the
fullness of Christian life." S

6
While not being formally identified with them, catechesis
is built on a certain number of elements of the Church's pastoral
mission which have a catechetical aspect, that prepare for cateche­
sis, or spring from it. They are: the initial proclamation of the
Gospel or missionary preaching to arouse faith; examination of the
reasons for belief; experience of Christian living; celebration of the
sacraments; integration into the ecclesial community; and apos­
tolic and missionary witness.9
7
"Catechesis is intimately bound up with the whole of the
Church's life. Not only her geographical extension and numerical
increase, but even more her inner growth and correspondence with
God's plan depend essentially on catechesis." 1 o
8
Periods of renewal in the Church are also intense moments of
catechesis. In the great era of the Fathers of the Church, saintly bishops
devoted an important part of their ministry to catechesis. St. Cyril of
Jerusalem and St. John Chrysostom, St. Ambrose and St. Augustine, and
many other Fathers wrote catechetical works that remain models for us. 1 1

9
"The ministry of catechesis draws ever fresh energy from the
councils. The Council of Trent is a noteworthy example of this. It gave
catechesis priority in its constitutions and decrees. It lies at the origin of
the Roman Catechism, which is also known by the name of that council and
which is a work of the first rank as a summary of Christian teaching . . "12

Prologue

The Council of Trent initiated a remarkable organization of the Church's
catechesis. Thanks to the work of holy bishops and theologians such as St.
Peter Canisius, St. Charles Borromeo, St. Turibius of Mongrovejo, or St.
Robert Bellarmine, it occasioned the publication of numerous catechisms.

10
It is therefore no surprise that catechesis in the Church has again
attracted attention in the wake of the Second Vatican Council, which Pope
Paul VI considered the great catechism of modern times. The General
Catechetical Directory (1971), the sessions of the Synod of Bishops devoted
to evangelization (1974) and catechesis (1977), the apostolic exhortations
Evangelii nuntiandi (1975) and Catechesi tradendae (1979) attest to this. The
Extraordinary Synod of Bishops in 1985 asked "that a catechism or com­
pendium of all Catholic doctrine regarding both faith and morals be
composed ." 13 The Holy Father, Pope John Paul II, made the Synod's wish
his own, acknowledging that "this desire wholly corresponds to a real
need of the universal Church and of the particular Churches.'' 14 He set in
motion everything needed to carry out the Synod Fathers' wish.
Ill.

THE AIM AND INTENDED READERSHIP OF THIS CATECHISM

11

This catechism aims a t presenting a n organic synthesis o f

the essential and fundamental contents o f Catholic doctrine, as
regards both faith and morals, in the light of the Second Vatican
Council and the whole of the Church's Tradition. Its principal
sources are the Sacred Scriptures, the Fathers of the Church, the
liturgy, and the Church's Magisterium. It is intended to serve "as
a point of reference for the catechisms or compendia that are
composed in the various countries."15

12

This work is intended primarily for those responsible for

catechesis: first of all the bishops, as teachers of the faith and
pastors of the Church. It is offered to them as an instrument in
fulfilling their resp onsibility of teaching the People of God.
Through the bishops, it is addressed to redactors of catechisms, to
priests, and to catechists. It will also be useful reading for all other
Christian faithful.

IV.

STRUCTURE OF THIS CATECHISM

13

The plan of this catechism is inspired by the great tradition

of catechisms which build catechesis on four pillars: the baptismal
profession of faith (the

the sacraments of faith, the life of

faith (the Commandments), and the prayer of the believer (the Lord's

Prayer).

Part One: The profession offaith
14

Those who belong to Christ through faith and Baptism

must confess their baptismal faith before men. 16 First therefore the
Catechism expounds revelation, by which God addresses and
gives himself to man, and the faith by which man responds to God

(Section One). The profession of faith summarizes the gifts that God
gives man: as the Author of all that is good; as Redeemer; and as
Sanctifier. It develops these in the three chapters on our baptismal
faith in the one God: the almighty Father, the Creator; his
Christ, our Lord and Savior; and the

Holy Spirit, the Sanctifier, in

(Section Two).

Part Two: The sacraments offaith
15

The second part of the Catechism explains how God's

salvation, accomplished once for all through Christ Jesus and the
Holy Spirit, is made present in the sacred actions of the Church's
liturgy

(Section One),

especially in the seven sacraments

(Section

Two).
Part Three: The life offaith
16

The third part of the Catechism deals with the final end of

man created in the image of God: beatitude, and the ways of
reaching it - through right conduct freely chosen, with the help of
God's law and grace (Section

One), and through conduct that fulfills

the twofold commandment of charity, specified in God's Ten
Commandments

(Section Two).

Part Four: Prayer in the life offaith
17

The last part of the Catechism deals with the meaning and

importance of prayer in the life of believers

(Section One).

It con­

cludes with a brief commentary on the seven petitions of the Lord's
Prayer

(Section Two), for indeed we find in these the sum of all the

good things which we must hope for and which our heavenly
Father wants to grant us.

Prologue

V.

PRACTICAL DIRECTIONS FOR USING THIS CATECHISM

This catechism is conceived as an organic presen ta tion of the
18
Catholic faith in its entirety. It should be seen therefore as a unified
whole. Numerous cross-references in the margin of the text (itali­
cized numbers referring to other paragraphs that deal with the
same theme), as well as the analytical index at the end of the
volume, allow the reader to view each theme in its relationship
with the entirety of the faith.
19
The texts of Sacred Scripture are often not quoted word for
word but are merely indicated by a reference (cf.) . For a deeper
understanding of such passages, the reader should refer to the
Scrip tural texts themselves. Such Biblical references are a valuable
working-tool in catechesis.
20
The use of small p rint in certain passages indicates observations
of an historical or apologetic nature, or supplementary doctrinal explana­
tions.
21

The qu otations, also in small print, from patristic, liturgical,
magisterial or hagiographical sources, are intended to enrich
the doctrinal presentations. These texts have often been
chosen with a view to direct catechetical use.

22

At the end of each thematic unit, a series of brief texts
sum up the essentials of that unit's teaching in con­
densed formulae. These IN BRIEF summaries may
suggest to local catechists brief summary formulae
that could be memorized .

VI.

NECESSARY ADAPTATIONS

The Catechism emphasizes the exposition of doctrine . It
seeks to help deepen understanding of faith. In this way it is
oriented toward the maturing of that faith, its putting down roots
in personal life and its shining forth in personal conductP
23

By design, this Catechism does not set out to provide the
adaptation of doctrinal presentations and catechetical methods
required by the differences of culture, age, spiritual matu rity, and
social and ecclesial condition among all those to whom it is ad­
dressed . Such indispensable adap tations are the responsibility of
particular catechisms and, even more, of those who instruct the
faithful:
24

17 Cf. CT 20-22, 25.

12

Prologue
Whoever teaches must become "all things to all men" (1 Cor
9:22), to win everyone to Christ. . . . Above all, teachers must
not imagine that a single kind of soul has been entrusted to
them, and that consequently it is lawful to teach and form
equally all the faithful in true piety with one and the same
method! Let them realize that some are in Christ as newborn
babes, others as adolescents, and still others as adults in full
command of their powers . . . . Those who are called to the
ministry of preaching must suit their words to the maturity
and understanding of their hearers, as they hand on the
teaching of the mysteries of faith and the rules of moral
conduct. 18

Above All
25

-

Charity

To conclude this Prologue, it is fitting to recall this pastoral

principle stated by the

Roman Catechism:

The whole concern of doctrine and its teaching must be
directed to the love that never ends. Whether something is
proposed for belief, for hope or for action, the love of our
Lord must always be made accessible, so that anyone can see
that all the works of perfect Christian virtue spring from love
and have no other objective than to arrive at love. 19

Fragment of a fresco from the catacomb of Priscilla in Rome, dating from the beginning
of the third century A.D. It is the most ancient image of the Blessed Virgin.
This image, among the most ancient in Christian art, expresses a theme that lies
at the heart of the Christian faith: the mystery of the incarnation of the Son of
God born of the Virgin Mary.
- At the left, the figure of a man pointing to a star, located above the Virgin with
the child : a prophet, probably Balaam, who announced that "a star shall come
forth out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel" (Num 24:17). This is the
whole expectation of the Old Covenant and the cry of a fallen humanity for a
savior and redeemer (cf. §§27; 528).
- This prophecy was fulfilled in the birth of Jesus, the incarnate Son of God,
conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary (cf. §§27;
53; 422; 488). Mary brought him into the world and gave him to all mankind. For
this reason she is the purest image of the Church (d. §967).

PART ONE
THE PROFESSION
OF FAITH
SECTION ONE

"I BELIEVE" - "WE B ELIEVE"
26

We begin our profession of faith by saying:

"I believe" or

"We believe. " Before expounding the Church 's faith, as confessed
in the Creed, celebrated in the liturgy, and lived in observance of
God's commandments and in prayer, we must first ask what "to
believe" means. Faith is man's response to God, who reveals
himself and gives himself to man, at the same time bringing man
a superabundant light as he searches for the ultimate meaning of

(Chapter One), then
(Chapter
Two), and finally the response of faith (Chapter Three).

MAN'S C APACITY FOR Goo

THE DESIRE FOR GOD

27

The desire for God is written in the human heart, because

man is created by God and for God; and God never ceases to draw
man to himself. Only in God will he find the truth and happiness
h e never stops searching for:
The dignity of man rests above all on the fact that he is called
to communion with God . This invitation to converse with
God is addressed to man as soon as he comes into being. For
if man exists, it is because God has created him through love,
and through love continues to hold him in existence. He
cannot live fully according to truth unless he freely acknow­
ledges that love and entrusts himself to his creator. 1

Part One
In

many ways, throughout history down to the present

day, men have given expression to their quest for God in their
religious beliefs and behavior: in their prayers, sacrifices, rituals,
meditations, and so forth. These forms of religious expression,
despite the ambiguities they often bring with them, are so universal
that one may well call man a

religious being:

From one ancestor [God] made all nations to inhabit the
whole earth, and he allotted the times of their existence and
the boundaries of the places where they would live, so that
they would search for God and perhaps grope for him and
find him - though indeed he is not far from each one of us.
For "in him we live and move and have our being."2

21 23-2128

But this "intimate and vital bond of man to God"

29

(GS 19,1)

can be forgotten, overlooked, or even explicitly rejected by man. 3

Such attitudes can have different causes: revolt against evil in the
world; religious ignorance or indifference; the cares and riches of
this world; the scandal of bad example on the part of believers;

398

currents of thought hostile to religion; finally, that attitude of sinful

man which makes him hide from God out of fear and flee his call. 4
"Let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.''5

30

2567, 845

Although man can forget God or reject him, He never ceases to call
every man to seek him, so as to find life and happiness. But this

368

search for God demands of man every effort of intellect, a sound
will, " an upright heart," as well as the witness of others who teach
him to seek God.
You are great, 0 Lord, and greatly to be praised: great is your
power and your wisdom is without measure. And man, so
small a part of your creation, wants to praise you: this man,
though clothed with mortality and bearing the evidence of
sin and the proof that you withstand the proud. Despite
everything, man, though but a small a part of your creation,
wants to praise you. You yourself encourage him to delight
in your praise, for you have made us for yourself, and our
heart is restless until it rests in you. 6

know him. These are also called proofs for the existence of God,
not in the sense of proofs in the natural sciences, but rather in the
sense of "converging and convincing arguments," which allow us
to attain certainty about the truth.
These "ways" of approaching God from creation have a
twofold point of departure: the physical world and the human
person.

32
The world: starting from movement, becoming, contingency, and the world's order and beauty, one can come to a 54, 337
knowledge of God as the origin and the end of the universe.
As St. Paul says of the Gentiles: For what can be known about
God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. Ever
since the creation of the world his invisible nature, namely,
his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in
the things that have been made ?
And St. Augustine issues this challenge: Question the beauty
of the earth, question the beauty of the sea, question the
beauty of the air distending and diffusing itself, question the
beauty of the sky . . . question all these realities. All respond:
"See, we are beautiful. " Their beauty is a profession [confes­
sio ]. These beauties are subject to change. Who made them if
not the Beautiful One [Pulcher] who is not subject to change ?8

33
The human person: With his openness to truth and beauty,
his sense of moral goodness, his freedom and the voice of his
conscience, with his longings for the infinite and for happiness,
man questions himself about God's existence. In all this he discerns
signs of his spiritual soul. The soul, the "seed of eternity we bear
in ourselves, irreducible to the merely material,"9 can have its
origin only in God.
34

2500, 1 730

1 703
366

The world, and man, attest that they contain within them­
selves neither their first principle nor their final end, but rather that
they participate in Being itself, which alone is without origin or
end . Thus, in different ways, man can come to know that there
exists a reality which is the first cause and final end of all things, a
1 99
reality "that everyone calls 'God. "' l O

Part One

35

Man's faculties make him capable of corning to a knowl­

edge of the existence of a personal God. But for man to be able to

50

enter into real intimacy with him, God willed both to reveal himself
to man and to give him the grace of being able to welcome this
revelation

159

in

faith. The proofs of God's existence, however, can

predispose one to faith and help one to see that faith is not opposed
to reason.

Ill.

THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD ACCORDING TO THE CHURCH

36

"Our holy mother, the Church, holds and teaches that

God, the first principle and last end of all things, can be known
with certainty from the created world by the natural light of human
reason." 1 1 Without this capacity, man would not be able to wel-

355

come God's revelation. Man has this capacity because he is created
"in the image of God. " 12

37

In the historical conditions in which he finds himself,

however, man experiences many difficulties in corning to know

1 960

God by the light of reason alone:
Though human reason is, strictly speaking, truly capable by
its own natural power and light of attaining to a true and
certain knowledge of the one personal God, who watches
over and controls the world by his providence, and of the
na tural la w written in our hearts by the Creator; yet there are
many obstacles which prevent reason from the effective and
fruitful use of this inborn faculty. For the truths that concern
the relations between God and man wholly transcend the
visible order of things, and, if they are translated into human
action and influence it, they call for self-surrender and abne­
gation. The human mind, in its turn, is hampered in the
attaining of such truths, not only by the impact of the senses
and the imagination, but also by disordered appetites which
are the consequences of original sin. So it happens that men
in such matters easily persuade themselves that what they
would not like to be true is false or at least doubtful. 13

38

This is why man stands in need of being enlightened by

God's revelation, not only about those things that exceed his

2036

understanding, but also "about those religious and moral truths
which of themselves are not beyond the grasp of human reason, so
that even in the present condition of the human race, they can be

known by all men with ease, with firm certainty and with n o
admixture o f error." 1 4

IV.

How CAN WE SPEAK ABOUT Goo?

39

In defending the ability of human reason to know God, the

Church is expressing her confidence in the possibility of speaking

851

about him to all men and with all men, and therefore of dialogue
with other religions, with philosophy and science, as well as with
unbelievers and atheists.

40

Since our knowledge of God is limited, our language about

him is equally so. We can name God only by taking creatures as
our starting point, and in accordance with our limited human ways
of knowing and thinking.

41

All creatures bear a certain resemblance to God, most

especially man, created in the image and likeness of God. The
manifold perfections of creatures-their truth, their goodness, their
beauty -all reflect the infinite perfection of God. Consequently we 2 1 3 , 299
can name God by taking his creatures' perfections as our starting
point, "for from the greatness and beauty of created things comes
a corresponding perception of their Creator." 1 5

42

God transcends all creatures. We must therefore continu-

ally purify our language of everything in it that is limited, image- 212, 300
bound or imperfect, if we are not to confuse our image of God - 3 70
"the inexpressible, the incomprehensible, the invisible, the un­
graspable"-with our human representations. 16 Our human words
always fall short of the mystery of God.

43

Admittedly, in speaking about God like this, our language

is using human modes of expression; nevertheless it really does
attain to God himself, though unable to express him in his infinite
simplicity. Likewise, we must recall that "between Creator and
creature no similitude can be expressed without implying an even
greater dissimilitude"; l 7 and that "concerning God, we cannot
grasp what he is, but only what he is not, and how other beings 206

stand in relation to him. " l 8

18

Part One

IN BRIEF
44

Man is by nature and vocation a religious being. Com­
ing from God, going toward God, man lives a fully
human life only if he freely lives by his bond with God.

45

Man is made to live in communion with God in whom
he finds happiness: "When I am completely united to
you, there will be no more sorrow or trials; entirely full
of you, my life will be complete " (St. Augustine,

10, 28, 39: PL 32, 795 ).

46

Conf

When h e listens t o the message o f creation and t o the
voice of conscience, man can arrive at certainty about
the existence of God, the cause and the end of every­
thing.

47

The Church teaches that the one true God, our Creator
and Lord, can be known with certainty from his
works, by the natural light of human reason (cf. Vati­

can Council I, can. 2,

48

§ 1:

DS

3026 ).

We really can name God, starting from the manifold
perfections of his creatures, which are likenesses of the
infinitely perfect God, even if our limited language
cannot exhaust the mystery.

49

"Without the Creator, the creature vanishes"

(GS 36 ).

This is the reason why believers know that the love of
Christ urges them to bring the light of the living God
to those who do not know him or who reject him.

MEET MAN

By natural reason man can know God with certainty, on

the basis of his works. But there is another order of knowledge,
which man cannot possibly arrive at by his own powers: the order 36
of divine Revelation. 1 Through an utterly free decision, God has
revealed himself and given himself to man. This he does by revealing the mystery, his plan of loving goodness, formed from all
eternity in Christ, for the benefit of all men. God has fully revealed 1 066
this plan by sending us his beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and
the Holy Spirit.

"It pleased God, in his goodness and wisdom, to reveal

that men should have access to the Father, through Christ, the

God, who "dwells in unapproachable light," wants to

communicate his own divine life to the men he freely created, in
order to adopt them as his sons in his only-begotten Son. 3 By
revealing himself God wishes to make them capable of responding
to him, and of knowing

St. lrenaeus of Lyons repeatedly speaks of this divine peda­
gogy using the image of God and man becoming accus­
tomed to one another: The Word of God dwelt in man and
became the Son of man in order to accustom man to perceive
God and to accustom God to dwell in man, according to the
Father's pleasure.5

THE STAGES OF REVELATION

In the beginning God makes himself known
54
"God, who creates and conserves all things by his Word,
32 provides men with constant evidence of himself in created realities .
And furthermore, wishing to open up the way to heavenly salva­
tion, he manifested himself to our first parents from the very
beginning." 6 He invited them to intimate communion with himself
374 and clothed them with resplendent grace and justice.

55
This revelation was not broken off by our first parents' sin.
397, 410 "After the fall, [God] buoyed them up with the hope of salvation,
by promising redemption; and he has never ceased to show his
solicitude for the human race. For he ·wishes to give eternal life to
all those who seek salvation by patience in well-doing." 7
Even when he disobeyed you and lost your friendship
you did not abandon him to the power of death . . . .
Again and again you offered a covenant to man.8

761

The Covenant with Noah
After the unity of the human race was shattered by sin God
at once sought to save humanity part by part. The covenant with
401 Noah after the flood gives expression to the principle of the divine
1 2 1 9 economy toward the "nations, " in other words, toward men
grouped "in their lands, each with [its] own language, by their
families, in their nations ." 9

56

57
This state of division into many nations is at once cosmic,
social, and religious. It is intended to limit the pride of fallen
humanity, 10 united only in its perverse ambition to forge its own

rmity as at Babel. 11 But, because of sin, both polytheism and the
idolatry of the nation and of its rulers constantly threaten this
provisional economy with the perversion of paganism. l 2
The covenant with Noah remains in force during the times
58
of the Gentiles, rmtil the rmiversal proclamation of the Gospei. 13
The Bible venerates several great figures among the Gentiles: Abel
the just, the king-priest Melchizedek - a figure of Christ - and the
upright "Noah, Daniel, and Job." 14 Scripture thus expresses the
heights of sanctity that can be reached by those who live according
to the covenant of Noah, waiting for Christ to " gather into one the
children of God who are scattered abroad. " 15

God chooses Abraham
59
In order to gather together scattered humanity God calls
Abram from his cormtry, his kindred, and his father's house, 16 and
makes him Abraham, that is, "the father of a multitude of nations."
"In you all the nations of the earth shall be blessed. " 17

The people descended from Abraham would be the trustees
60
of the promise made to the patriarchs, the chosen people, called to
prepare for that day when God would gather all his children into the
unity of the Church. 18 They would be the root onto which the Gentiles
would be grafted, once they came to believe.l 9

The patriarchs, prophets, and certain other Old Testament
61
figures have been and always will be honored as saints in all the
Church's liturgical traditions.
God forms his people Israel
62
After the patriarchs, God formed Israel as his people by
freeing them from slavery in Egypt. He established with them the
covenant of Mount Sinai and, through Moses, gave them his law
so that they would recognize him and serve him as the one living

would look for the promised Savior. 20
Israel is the priestly people of God, "called by the name of
63
the LORD," and "the first to hear the word of God,"21 the people of
"elder brethren" in the faith of Abraham.
64
Through the prophets, God forms his people in the hope
of salvation, in the expectation of a new and everlasting Covenant
intended for all, to be written on their hearts. 22 The prophets
proclaim a radical redemption of the People of God, purification
from all their infidelities, a salvation which will include all the
nations. 23 Above all, the poor and humble of the Lord will bear this
hope. Such holy women as Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, Miriam, Deborah, Hannah, Judith, and Esther kept alive the hope of Israel's
salvation. The purest figure among them is Mary. 24

"In many and various ways God spoke of old to our fathers
65
by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by a
Son.'' 26 Christ, the Son of God made man, is the Father's one,
perfect, and unsurpassable Word. In him he has said everything;
there will be no other word than this one. St. John of the Cross,
among others, commented strikingly on Hebrews 1:1-2:
In giving us his Son, his only Word (for he possesses no
other), he spoke everything to us at once in this sole Word ­
and he has no more to say . . . because what he spoke before
to the prophets in parts, he has now spoken all at once by
giving us the All Who is His Son. Any person questioning
God or desiring some vision or revelation would be guilty
not only of foolish behavior but also of offending him, by not
fixing his eyes entirely upon Christ and by living with the
27
desire for some other novelty.

The Profession of Faith
There will be no further Revelation

"The Christian economy, therefore, since it is the new and
definitive Covenant, will never pass away; and no new public
revelation is to be expected before the glorious manifestation of our
Lord Jesus Christ." 28 Yet even if Revelation is already complete, it
has not been made completely explicit; it remains for Christian
faith gradually to grasp its full significance over the course of the 94
centuries.

66

Throughout the ages, there have been so-called "private " revela­
67
tions, some of which have been recognized by the authority of the Church.
They do not belong, however, to the deposit of faith. It is not their role to
improve or complete Christ's definitive Revelation, but to help live more
fully by it in a certain period of history. Guided by the magisterium of the
Church, the sensus fidelium knows how to discern and welcome in these
revelations whatever constitutes an authentic call of Christ or his saints to
the Church.
Christian faith cannot accept "revelations" that claim to surpass
or correct the Revelation of which Christ is the fulfillment, as is the case in
certain non-Christian religions and also in certain recent sects which base
themselves on such "revelations."

IN BRIEF
68

By love, God has revealed himself and given himself
to man. He has thus provided the definitive, super­
abundant answer to the questions that man asks him­
self about the meaning and purpose of his life.

69

God has revealed himself to man by gradually com­
municating his own mystery in deeds and in words.

70

Beyond the witness to himself that God gives in cre­
ated things, he manifested himself to our first parents,
spoke to them and, after the fall, promised them sal­
vation (cf. Gen 3:15) and offered them his covenant.

71

God made an everlasting covenant with Noah and
with all living beings (cf. Gen 9:16). It will remain in
force as long as the world lasts.

72

God chose Abraham and made a covenant with him
and his descendants. By the covenant God formed his
people and revealed his law to them through Moses.

28 DV 4; cf. 1 Tim 6:14; Titus 2:13.

84

93

24

Part One
Through the prophets, he prepared them to accept the
salvation destined for all humanity.

73

God has revealed himself fully by sending his own
Son, in whom he has established his covenant for ever.
The Son is his Father's definitive Word; so there will
be no further Revelation after him.

ARTICLE 2

THE TRANSMIS SION OF DIVINE REVELATION

74
God "desires all men to be saved and to come to the
knowledge of the truth": 29 that is, of Christ Jesus. 3° Christ must be
851 proclaimed to all nations and individuals, so that this revelation
may reach to the ends of the earth:
God graciously arranged that the things he had once re­
vealed for the salvation of all peoples should remain in their
entirety, throughout the ages, and be transmitted to all gen­
1
erations.3

I.

THE APOSTOLIC TRADITION

75
"Christ the Lord, in whom the entire Revelation of the
most high God is s umme d up, commanded the apostles to preach
the Gospel, which had been promised beforehand by the prophets,
and which he fulfilled in his own person and promulgated with his
own lips. In preaching the Gospel, they were to communicate the
gifts of God to all men. This Gospel was to be the source of all
1 71 saving truth and moral discipline. " 32
In the apostolic preaching . . .
76
In keeping with the Lord's command, the Gospel was
handed on in two ways:

- orally "by the apostles who handed on, by the spoken word of
their preaching, by the example they gave, by the institutions they
established, what they themselves had received - whether from the

25

lips of Christ, from his way of life and his works, or whether they
had learned it at the prompting of the Holy Spirit";33

- in writing "by those apostles and other men associated with the
apostles who, under the inspiration of the same Holy Spirit, com­
mitted the message of salvation to writing." 34
. . . continued in apostolic succession

"In order that the full and living Gospel might always be
77
preserved in the Church the apostles left bishops as their succes­
sors. They gave them 'their own position of teaching authority."'35
Indeed, "the apostolic preaching, which is expressed in a special
way in the inspired books, was to be preserved in a continuous line
of succession until the end of time." 36
78
This living transmission, accomplished in the Holy Spirit,
is called Tradition, since it is distinct from Sacred Scripture, though
closely connected to it. Through Tradition, "the Church, in her
doctrine, life, and worship perpetuates and transmits to every
generation all that she herself is, all that she believes."37 "The
sayings of the holy Fathers are a witness to the life-giving presence
of this Tradition, showing how its riches are poured out in the
practice and life of the Church, in her belief and her prayer.''38
79
The Father's self-communication made through his Word
in the Holy Spirit, remains present and active in the Church: "God,
who spoke in the past, continues to converse with the Spouse of
his beloved Son. And the Holy Spirit, through whom the living
voice of the Gospel rings out in the Church - and through her in
the world - leads believers to the full truth, and makes the Word
of Christ dwell in them in all its richness." 39

THE RELATIONSHIP BETIVEEN TRADITION
AND SACRED SCRIPTURE

One common source . . .
80
"Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture, then, are bound
closely together and communicate one with the other. For both of
them, flowing out from the same divine well-spring, come together
in some fashion to form one thing and move towards the same
goal." 40 Each of them makes present and fruitful in the Church the
mystery of Christ, who promised to remain with his own "always,
to the close of the age." 41
. . . two distinct modes of transmission

"Sacred Scripture is the speech of God as it is put down in
81
writing under the breath of the Holy Spirit." 42
113

"And [Holy] Tradition transmits in its entirety the Word of
God which has been entrusted to the apostles by Christ the Lord
and the Holy Spirit. It transmits it to the successors of the apostles
so that, enlightened by the Spirit of truth, they may faithfully
preserve, expound, and spread it abroad by their preaching." 43
As a result the Church, to whom the transmission and
interpretation of Revelation is entrusted, "does not derive her
certainty about all revealed truths from the holy Scriptures alone.
Both Scripture and Tradition must be accepted and honored with
equal sentiments of devotion and reverence." 44

82

Apostolic Tradition and ecclesial traditions
83
The Tradi tion here in question comes from the apostles and
hands on what they received from Jesus' teaching and example and what
they learned from the Holy Spirit. The first generation of Christians did
not yet have a written New Testament, and the New Testament itself
demonstrates the process of l iving Tradition.

1 202, 2041

Tradi tion is to be distinguished from the various theological,
disciplinary, liturgical, or devotional tradi tions, born in the local churches
over time. These are the particular forms, adapted to different pl aces and

times, in which the great Tradition is expressed. In the light of Tradition,
these traditions can be retained, modified or even abandoned under the
guidance of the Church's magisterium.

Ill.

THE INTERPRETATION OF THE H ERITAGE OF fAITH

The heritage of faith entrusted to the whole of the Church
The apostles entrusted the "Sacred deposit" of the faith
(the depositum fidei),45 contained in Sacred Scripture and Tradition,
to the whole of the Church. "By adhering to [this heritage] the 857, 871
entire holy people, united to its pastors, remains always faithful to
the teaching of the apostles, to the brotherhood, to the breaking of 2033
bread and the prayers. So, in maintaining, practicing, and professing the faith that has been handed on, there should be a remarkable
harmony between the bishops and the faithful."46

84

The Magisterium of the Church
85
"The task of giving an authentic interpretation of the Word
of God, whether in its written form or in the form of Tradition, has
been entrusted to the living, teaching office of the Church alone.
Its authority in this matter is exercised in the name of Jesus 888-892
Christ."47 This means that the task of interpretation has been 2032-2040
entrusted to the bishops in communion with the successor of Peter,
the Bishop of Rome.
"Yet this Magisterium is not superior to the Word of God,
but is its servant. It teaches only what has been handed on to it. At
the divine command and with the help of the Holy Spirit, it listens
to this devotedly, guards it with dedication, and expounds it 688
faithfully. All that it proposes for belief as being divinely revealed
is drawn from this single deposit of faith."48

86

87
Mindful of Christ's words to his apostles: "He who hears 1 548
you, hears me,"49 the faithful receive with docility the teachings 203 7
and directives that their pastors give them in different forms.

45 DV 10 § l;cf. 1 Tim 6:20; 2 Tim 1 :12-14 (Vulg.).
46 DV 10 § 1; cf. Acts 2:42 (Gk.); Pius XII, apostolic constitution,
Munificentissimus Deus, November 1, 1950: AAS 42 (1950), 756, taken along
with the words of St. Cyprian, Epist. 66, 8: CSEL 3, 2, 733: "The Church is

Part One

The dogmas of the faith
888-892,
2032-2040

88

The Church's Magisterium exercises the authority it holds

from Christ to the fullest extent when it defines dogmas, that is,
when it proposes, in a form obliging the Christian people to an
irrevocable adherence of faith, truths contained in divine Revela­
tion or also when it proposes, in a definitive way, truths having a
necessary connection with these.
89

2625

There is an organic connection between our spiritual life

and the dogmas. Dogmas are lights along the path of faith; they
illuminate it and make it secure. Conversely, if our life is upright,
our intellect and heart will be open to welcome the light shed by
the dogmas of faith. 50

90

The mutual connections between dogmas, and their coher­

ence, can be found in the whole of the Revelation of the mystery of
1 1 4, 158 Christ. 51 "In Catholic doctrine there exists an order or 'hierarchy'
234

of truths, since they vary in their relation to the foundation of the

Christian faith. "52

The supernatural sense of faith
91
737

All the faithful share in understanding and handing on

revealed truth. They have received the anointing of the Holy Spirit
who instructs them53 and guides them into all truth. 54

92

"The whole body of the faithful . . . cannot err in matters

of belief. This characteristic is shown in the supernatural apprecia785 tion of faith

(sensus fidez)

on the part of the whole people, when,

'from the bishops to the last of the faithful,' they manifest a univer­
sal consent in matters of faith and morals . " 55

93

"By this appreciation of the faith, aroused and sustained

by the Spirit of truth, the People of God, guided by the sacred
889

teaching authority

(Magisterium), .

. . receives . . . the faith, once for

all delivered to the saints . . . . The People unfailingly adheres to this
faith, penetrates it more deeply with right judgment, and applies

it more fully in daily life."56

Growth in understanding the faith
94
Thanks to the assistance of the Holy Spirit, the understanding of both the realities and the words of the heritage of faith
is able to grow in the life of the Church:

66

- "through the contemplation and study of believers who ponder
these things in their hearts";57 it is in particular "theological re­
search [which] deepens knowledge of revealed truth."58

2651

- "from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which [believers]
experience," 59 the sacred Scriptures "grow with the one who
reads them. " 60

2038, 251 8

- "from the preaching of those who have received, along with their
right of succession in the episcopate, the sure charism of truth." 61
95
"It is clear therefore that, in the supremely wise arrange­
ment of God, sacred Tradition, Sacred Scripture, and the Magis­
teriurn of the Church are so connected and associated that one of
them cannot stand without the others. Working together, each in
its own way, under the action of the one Holy Spirit, they all
contribute effectively to the salvation of souls. " 62

IN BRIEF
96

What Christ entrusted to the apostles, they in tum
handed on by their preaching and writing, under the
inspiration of the Holy Spirit, to all generations, until
Christ returns in glory.

"Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture make up a
single sacred deposit of the Word of God" (DV 10), in

ARTICLE 3

SA CRED SCRIPTURE
I.

CHRIST - THE UNIQUE WORD OF SACRED SCRIPTURE

101
In order to reveal himself to men, in the condescension of
his goodness God speaks to them in human words: "Indeed the
words of God, expressed in the words of men, are in every way like
human language, just as the Word of the eternal Father, when he
took on himself the flesh of human weakness, became like men." 63
102
Through all the words of Sacred Scripture, God speaks
65, 2 763 only one single Word, his one Utterance in whom he expresses
himself completely: 64

426-429

You recall that one and the same Word of God extends
throughout Scripture, that it is one and the same Utterance
that resounds in the mouths of all the sacred writers, since
he who was in the beginning God with God has no need of
separate syllables; for he is not subject to time. 65

103
For this reason, the Church has always venerated the
Scriptures as she venerates the Lord's Body. She never ceases to
1 1 00, 1 1 84 present to the faithful the bread of life, taken from the one table of
1378 God's Word and Christ's Body. 66
104
In Sacred Scripture, the Church constantly finds her nour­
ishment and her strength, for she welcomes it not as a human word,
"but as what it really is, the word of God. " 67 "In the sacred books,

INSPIRATION AND TRUTH OF SACRED SCRIPTURE

105
God is the author of Sacred Scripture. "The divinely revealed
realities, which are contained and presented in the text of Sacred
Scripture, have been written down under the inspiration of the
Holy Spirit."69
"For Holy Mother Church, relying on the faith of the
apostolic age, accepts as sacred and canonical the books of the Old
and the New Testaments, whole and entire, with all their parts, on
the grounds that, written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit,
they have God as their author and have been handed on as such to
the Church herse1f." 70
106
God inspired the human authors of the sacred books. "To
compose the sacred books, God chose certain men who, all the
while he employed them in this task, made full use of their own
faculties and powers so that, though he acted in them and by them,
it was as true authors that they consigned to writing whatever he
wanted written, and no more." 71
107
The inspired books teach the truth. "Since therefore all that
the inspired authors or sacred writers affirm should be regarded
as affirmed by the Holy Spirit, we must acknowledge tha t the books
of Scripture firmly, faithfully, and without error teach that truth 702
which God, for the sake of our salvation, wished to see confided to
the Sacred Scriptures. "72
Still, the Christian faith is not a "religion of the book."
Christianity is the religion of the "Word" of God, a word which is
"not a written and mute word, but the Word which is incarnate and
living."73 If the Scriptures are not to remain a dead letter, Christ,
the eternal Word of the living God, must, through the Holy Spirit,
"open [our] minds to understand the Scriptures ." 74

THE HOLY SPIRIT, INTERPRETER OF SCRIPTURE

109
In Sacred Scripture, God speaks to man in a human way.
To interpret Scripture correctly, the reader must be attentive to
what the human authors truly wanted to affirm and to what God
wanted to reveal to us by their words?5
110
In order to discover the sacred authors' intention, the reader
must take into account the conditions of their time and culture, the
literary genres in use at that time, and the modes of feeling,
speaking, and narrating then current. "For the fact is that truth is
differently presented and expressed in the various types of histori­
cal writing, in prophetical and poetical texts, and in other forms of
literary expression." 76
111
But since Sacred Scripture is inspired, there is another and
no less important principle of correct interpretation, without which
Scripture would remain a dead letter. "Sacred Scripture must be
read and interpreted in the light of the same Spirit by whom it was
written." 77
The Second Vatican Council indicates three criteria for
interpreting Scripture in accordance with the Spirit who inspired
it?8
112
1 . Be especially attentive "to the content and unity of the whole
Scripture. " Different as the books which comprise it may be, Scrip-

128
368

ture is a unity by reason of the unity of God's plan, of which Christ
Jesus is the center and heart, open since his Passover?9
The phrase "heart of Christ" can refer to Sacred Scripture,
which makes known his heart, closed before the Passion, as
the Scripture was obscure. But the Scripture has been opened
since the Passion; since those who from then on have under­
stood it, consider and discern in what way the prophecies
must be interpreted. 80

113
2. Read the Scripture within "the living Tradition of the whole
Church." According to a saying of the Fathers, Sacred Scripture is
81

written principally in the Church's heart rather than in documents
and records, for the Church carries in her Tradition the living
memorial of God's Word, and it is the Holy Spirit who gives her

The senses of Scripture
According to an ancient tradition, one can distinguish between
115
two senses of Scripture: the literal and the spiritual, the latter being subdi­
vided into the allegorical, moral, and anagogical senses. The profound
concordance of the four senses guarantees all its richness to the living
reading of Scripture in the Church.

116
The literal sense is the meaning conveyed by the words of Scrip­
ture and discovered by exegesis, following the rules of sound interpreta83
tion: "All other senses of Sacred Scripture are based on the literal."
The sp iritual sense. Thanks t o the unity o f God's plan, not only
the text of Scripture but also the realities and events about which it speaks
can be signs.

1 1 0-114

117

1 1 01

1. The allegorical sense. We can acquire a more profound under­
standing of events by recognizing their significance in Christ; thus the
crossing of the Red Sea is a sign or type of Christ's victory and also of
Christian Baptism. 84

2. The moral sense. The events reported in Scripture ought to lead
us to act justly. As St. Paul says, they were written "for our instruction.''85
3. The ana go gica l se nse (Greek: a nagoge, "leading"). We can view
realities and events in terms of their eternal significance, leading us toward
our true homeland: thus the Church on earth is a sign of the heavenly
Jerusalem. 86

118

A medieval couplet summarizes the significance of the four senses:
The Letter speaks of deeds; Allegory to faith;
The Moral how to act; Anagogy our destiny.87

"It is the task of exegetes to work, according to these rules,
toward a better understanding and explanation of the meaning of
Sacred Scripture in order that their research may help the Church 94

THE CANON OF SCRIPTURE

120
It was by the apostolic Tradition that the Church discerned
1 1 1 7 which writings are to be included in the list of the sacred books. 90
This complete list is called the canon of Scripture. It includes 46
books for the Old Testament (45 if we count Jeremiah and Lamen­
tations as one) and 27 for the New.9 1
The Old Testament: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deu­
teronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, 1 and 2
Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah, Tobit, Judith, Esther, 1 and 2 Maccabees,
Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, the Song of Songs, the Wisdom of
Solomon, Sirach (Ecclesiasticus), Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Baruch,
Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum,
Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zachariah and Malachi.
The New Testamen t: the Gospels according to Matthew, Mark, Luke
and John, the Acts of the Apostles, tlze Letters of St. Paul to the Romans, 1
and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2
Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, the Letter to the Hebrews,
the Letters of James, 1 and 2 Peter, 1, 2, and 3 John, and Jude, and Revelation
(the Apocalypse) .

The Old Testament
1 21

The Old Testament is an indispensable part of Sacred

1 093 Scripture. Its books are divinely inspired and retain a permanent
value,92 for the Old Covenant has never been revoked.

Indeed, "the economy of the Old Testament was deliber­
ately so oriented that it should prepare for and declare in prophecy
702, 763 the coming of Christ, redeemer of all men."93 "Even though they
contain matters imperfect and provisional," 94 the books of the Old
708 Testament bear witness to the whole divine pedagogy of God's

saving love: these writings "are a storehouse of sublime teaching
on God and of sound wisdom on human life, as well as a wonderful
treasury of prayers; in them, too, the mystery of our salvation is 2568
present in a hidden way."95

123
Christians venerate the Old Testament as true Word of
God. The Church has always vigorously opposed the idea of
rejecting the Old Testament under the pretext that the New has
rendered it void (Marcionism).
The New Testament
124
"The Word of God, which is the power of God for salvation
to everyone who has faith, is set forth and displays its power in a
most wonderful way in the writings of the New Testament"96
which hand on the ultimate truth of God's Revelation. Their central
object is Jesus Christ, God's incarnate Son: his acts, teachings,
Passion and glorification, and his Church's beginnings under the
Spirit's guidance.97
125
The Gospels are the heart of all the Scriptures "because they
are our principal source for the life and teaching of the Incarnate 515
Word, our Savior. "98
126

We can distinguish three stages in the formation of the Gospels:

1. The life and teaching of Jesus. The Church holds firmly that the
four Gospels, "whose historicity she unhesitatingly affirms, faithfully
hand on what Jesus, the Son of God, while he lived among men, really did
and taught for their eternal salvation, until the day when he was taken
up ."99

2. The oral tradition. "For, after the ascension of the Lord, the 76
apostles handed on to their hearers what he had said and done, but with
that fuller understanding which they, instructed by the glorious events of
Christ and enlightened by the Spirit of truth, now enjoyed." 100
3. The written Gospels. "The sacred authors, in writing the four 76
Gospels, selected certain of the many elements which had been handed on,
either orally or already in written form; others they synthesized or ex­
plained with an eye to the situation of the churches, while sustaining the

form of preaching, but always in such a fashion that they have told us the

1 1 54

127
The fourfold Gospel holds a unique place in the Church, as
is evident both in the veneration which the liturgy accords it and in
the surpassing attraction it has exercised on the saints at all times:
There is no doctrine which could be better, more precious
and more splendid than the text of the Gospel. Behold and
retain what our Lord and Master, Christ�,. has taught by his
words and accomplished by his deeds. l OL
But above all it's the Gospels that occupy my mind when I'm
at prayer; my poor soul has so many needs, and yet this is
the one thing needful. I'm always finding fresh lights there,
hidden and enthralling meanings. 103

2 705

The unity of the Old and New Testaments
The Church, as early as apostolic times, 1 04 and then con­
stantly in her Tradition, has illuminated the unity of the divine plan
in the two Testaments through typology, which discerns in God's
1 094 works of the Old Covenant prefigurations of what he accom489 plished in the fullness of time in the person of his incarnate Son.

128

129
Christians therefore read the Old Testament in the light of
Christ crucified and risen. Such typological reading discloses the
681 inexhaustible content of the Old Testament; but it must not make
us forget that the Old Testament retains its own intrinsic value as
Revelation reaffirmed by our Lord himsel£. 1 °5 Besides, the New
2055 Testament has to be read in the light of the Old. Early Christian
catechesis made constant use of the Old Testament. 106 As an old
saying put it, the New Testament lies hidden in the Old and the
1 968 Old Testament is unveiled in the New. 107
Typology indicates the dynamic movement toward the
fulfillment of the divine plan when "God [will] be everything to
everyone." 108 Nor do the calling of the patriarchs and the exodus
from Egypt, for example, lose their own value in God's plan, from
the mere fact that they were intermediate stages.

SACRED SCRIPTURE IN THE LIFE OF THE CHURCH

131

"And such is the force and power of the Word of God that

it can serve the Church as her support and vigor and the children
of the Church as strength for their faith, food for the soul, and a
pure and lasting font of spiritual life . " 109 Hence "access to Sacred
Scripture ought to be open wide to the Christian faithfui."llO

132

"Therefore, the 'study of the sacred page' should be the

very soul of sacred theology. The ministry of the Word, too ­
pastoral preaching, catechetics, and all forms of Christian instruc-

94

tion, among which the liturgical homily should hold pride of place
- is healthily nourished and thrives in holiness through the Word
of Scripture ." 1 1 1

133

The Church "forcefully and specifically exhorts all the

Christian faithful . . . to learn 'the surpassing knowledge of Jesus
Christ,' by frequent reading of the divine Scriptures. 'Ignorance of
the Scriptures is ignorance of Christ."'l 12

IN BRIEF
134

All Sacred Scripture is but one book, and this one
book is Christ, "because all divine Scripture speaks
of Christ, and all divine Scripture is fulfilled in
Christ" (Hugh of St. Victor,

De area Noe 2, 8: PL 176,

642 : cf. ibid . 2, 9: PL 176, 642-643) .

135

"The Sacred Scriptures contain the Word of God and,
because they are inspired they are truly the Word of
God"

136

(DV 24) .

God i8 the author of Sacred Scripture because he in­
spired its human authors; he acts in them and by means
of them. He thus gives assurance that their writings
teach without error his saving truth (cf.

137

D V 11).

Interpretation of the inspired Scripture must be atten­
tive above all to what God wants to reveal through the
sacred authors for our salvation. What comes from the

Spirit is not fully "understood except by the Spirit's
action" (d. Origen, Hom. in Ex. 4, 5: PG 12, 320).
138

The Church accepts and venerates as inspired the 46
books of the Old Testament and the 27 books of the
New.

139

The four Gospels occupy a central place because
Christ Jesus is their center.

140

The unity of the two Testaments proceeds from the
unity of God's plan and his Revelation. The Old Tes­
tament prepares for the New and the New Testament
fulfills the Old; the two shed light on each other; both
are true Word of God.

141

"The Church has always venerated the divine Scrip­
tures as she venerated the Body of the Lord" (DV 21):
both nourish and govern the whole Christian life.

MAN'S REsPONSE TO Goo
142
By his Revelation, "the invisible God, from the fullness of
his love, addresses men as his friends, and moves among them, in
order to invite and receive them into his own company." 1 The
adequate response to this invitation is faith.

1 1 02

143
By faith, man completely submits his intellect and his will
to God. 2 With his whole being man gives his assent to God the
revealer. Sacred Scripture calls this human response to God, the
author of revelation, "the obedience of faith." 3

THE OBEDIENCE OF fAITH

144
To obey (from the Latin ob-audire, to "hear or listen to") in
faith is to submit freely to the word that has been heard, because
its truth is guaranteed by God, who is Truth itself. Abraham is the
model of such obedience offered us by Sacred Scripture. The Virgin
Mary is its most perfect embodiment.
Abraham - "father of all who believe"
145
The Letter to the Hebrews, in its great eulogy of the faith of
Israel's ancestors, lays special emphasis on Abraham's faith: "By
faith, Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place
which he was to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not
knowing where he was to go."4 By faith, he lived as a stranger and
pilgrim in the promised land.5 By faith, Sarah was given to conceive the son of the promise. And by faith Abraham offered his only
son in sacrifice. 6
146
Abraham thus fulfills the definition of faith in Hebrews
11:1: "Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of
things not seen" : 7 "Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to

him as righteousness." 8 Because he was "strong in his faith,"
Abraham became the "father of all who believe." 9
147
The Old Testament is rich in witnesses to this faith. The
839 Letter to the Hebrews proclaims its eulogy of the exemplary faith of
the ancestors who "received divine approval.'' l O Yet "God had
foreseen something better for us": the grace of believing in his Son
Jesus, "the pioneer and perfecter of our faith." ll

Mary - "Blessed is she who believed"
148
The Virgin Mary most perfectly embodies the obedience
494, 261 7 of faith. By faith Mary welcomes the tidings and promise brought
by the angel Gabriel, believing that "with God nothing will be
impossible" and so giving her assent: "Behold I am the handmaid
of the Lord; let it be [done] to me according to your word.'' 12
506 Elizabeth greeted her: "Blessed is she who believed that there
would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord." 13
It is for this faith that all generations have called Mary blessed. 14
149
Throughout her life and until her last ordeal15 when Jesus
969 her son died on the cross, Mary's faith never wavered. She never
507, 829 ceased to believe in the fulfillment of God's word. And so the
Church venerates in Mary the purest realization of faith.

"I KNow WHOM I HAVE BELIEVED" 16

To b elieve in God alone
150
Faith is first of all a personal adherence of man to God. At
the same time, and inseparably, it is a free assent to the whole truth
222 that God has revealed. As personal adherence to God and assent to
his truth, Christian faith differs from our faith in any human
person. It is right and just to entrust oneself wholly to God and to

believe absolutely what he says. It would be futile and false to place
such faith in a creatureP
To believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God
151
For a Christian, believing in God cannot be separated from
believing in the One he sent, his "beloved Son," in whom the Father
is "well pleased"; God tells us to listen to him. 18 The Lord himself
said to his disciples: "Believe in God, believe also in me." 19 We can
believe in Jesus Christ because he is himself God, the Word made
flesh: "No one has ever seen God; the only Son, who is in the bosom
of the Father, he has made him known." 20 Because he "has seen the 424
Father," Jesus Christ is the only one who knows him and can reveal
him. 21
To believe in the Holy Spirit
152
One cannot believe in Jesus Christ without sharing in his
Spirit. It is the Holy Spirit who reveals to men who Jesus is. For "no 243, 683
one can say 'Jesus is Lord,' except by the Holy Spirit,"22 who
"searches everything, even the depths of God . . . . No one comprehends the thoughts of God, except the Spirit of God."23 Only God
knows God completely: we believe in the Holy Spirit because he is
God.

The Church never ceases to proclaim her faith in one only God: 232
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

THE CHARACTERISTICS OF FAITH

Faith is a grace
153
When St. Peter confessed that Jesus is the Christ, the Son
of the living God, Jesus declared to him that this revelation did not 552
come "from flesh and blood," but from "my Father who is in
heaven." 24 Faith is a gift of God, a supernatural virtue infused by him.

1 814 to move and assist him; he must have the interior helps of the Holy
1 996 Spirit, who moves the heart and converts it to God, who opens the
2606 eyes of the mind and 'makes it easy for all to accept and believe the
truth.'" 25
Faith is a human act
154
Believing is possible only by grace and the interior helps
1 749 of the Holy Spirit. But it is no less true that believing is an authen­
tically human act. Trusting in God and cleaving to the truths he has
revealed are contrary neither to human freedom nor to human
reason. Even in human relations it is not contrary to our dignity to
believe what other persons tell us about themselves and their
intentions or to trust their promises (for example, when a man and
2126 a woman marry) to share a communion of life with one another. If
this is so, still less is it contrary to our dignity to "yield by faith the
full submission of . . . intellect and will to God who reveals," 26 and
to share in an interior communion with him.
155
In faith, the human intellect and will cooperate with divine
2008 grace : "Believing is an act of the intellect assenting to the divine
truth by command of the will moved by God through grace."27
Faith and understanding

1 063
2465

156
What moves us to believe is not the fact that revealed
truths appear as true and intelligible in the light of our natural
reason: we believe "because of the authority of God himself who
reveals them, who can neither deceive nor be deceived." 28 So "that
the submission of our faith might nevertheless be in accordance
with reason, God willed that external proofs of his Revelation
should be joined to the internal helps of the Holy Spirit." 29 Thus
the miracles of Christ and the saints, prophecies, the Church's
growth and holiness, and her fruitfulness and stability "are the
most certain signs of divine Revelation, adapted to the intelligence
of all"; they are "motives of credibility" (motiva credibilitatis), which
show that the assent of faith is "by no means a blind impulse of the
mind." 30

Faith is certain. It is more certain than all human knowl­
edge because it is founded on the very word of God who cannot
lie. To be sure, revealed truths can seem obscure to human reason
and experience, but "the certainty that the divine light gives is
greater than that which the light of natural reason gives."3 1 "Ten
2088
thousand difficulties do not make one doubt."32
158
"Faith seeks understanding": 33 it is intrinsic to faith that a
believer desires to know better the One in whom he has put his
faith and to understand better what He has revealed; a more
penetrating knowledge will in tum call forth a greater faith, in­
creasingly set afire by love. The grace of faith opens "the eyes of
your hearts"34 to a lively understanding of the contents of Revelation: that is, of the totality of God's plan and the mysteries of faith,
of their connection with each other and with Christ, the center of
the revealed mystery. "The same Holy Spirit constantly perfects
faith by his gifts, so that Revelation may be more and more pro­
foundly understood." 35 In the words of St. Augustine, "I believe,

Faith and science: "Though faith is above reason, there can
never be any real discrepancy between faith and reason. Since the
same God who reveals mysteries and infuses faith has bestowed
the light of reason on the human mind, God cannot deny himself, 283
nor can truth ever contradict truth."37 "Consequently, methodical
research in all branches of knowledge, provided it is carried out in
a truly scientific manner and does not override moral laws, can
never conflict with the faith, because the things of the world and 2293
the things of faith derive from the same God. The humble and
persevering investigator of the secrets of nature is being led, as it
were, by the hand of God in spite of himself, for it is God, the
conserver of all things, who made them what they are."38

The freedom of faith
To be human, "man's response to God by faith must be
free, and . . . therefore nobody is to be forced to embrace the faith
1 738, 2106 against his will . The act of faith is of its very nature a free act." 39
"God calls men to serve him in spirit and in truth. Consequently
they are bound to him in conscience, but not coerced . . . . This fact
received its fullest manifestation in Christ Jesus."40 Indeed, Christ
invited people to faith and conversion, but never coerced them.
'' For he bore witness to the truth but refused to use force to impose
it on those who spoke against it. His kingdom . . . grows by the love
616 with which Christ, lifted up on the cross, draws men to himse!f."4 1
160

The necessity of faith
161
Believing in Jesus Christ and in the One who sent him for
our salvation is necessary for obtaining that salvation. 42 "Since
432, 1257 'without faith it is impossible to please [God]' and to attain to the
fellowship of his sons, therefore without faith no one has ever
attained justification, nor will anyone obtain eternal life 'but he
846 who endures to the end ."'43
Perseverance in faith
162
Faith is an entirely free gift that God makes to man. We can
lose this priceless gift, as St. Paul indicated to St. Timothy: "Wage
2089 the good warfare, holding faith and a good conscience. By rejecting
conscience, certain persons have made shipwreck of their faith."44
To live, grow, and persevere in the faith until the end we must
nourish it with the word of God; we must beg the Lord to increase
1037, 2016, our faith;45 it must be "working through charity," abounding in
2573, 2849 hope, and rooted in the faith of the Church .46

The Profession of Faith

45

Faith - the beginning of eternal life
163
Faith makes us taste in advance the light of the beatific
vision, the goal of our journey here below. Then we shall see God 1088
"face to face," "as he is."47 So faith is already the beginning of
eternal life:
When we contemplate the blessings of faith even now, as if
gazing at a reflection in a mirror, it is as if we already
possessed the wonderful things which our faith assures us
we shall one day enjoy. 48

Now, however, "we walk by faith, not by sight";49 we
164
perceive God as "in a mirror, dimly" and only "in part." 50 Even
though enlightened by him in whom it believes, faith is often lived
in darkness and can be put to the test. The world we live in often 2846
seems very far from the one promised us by faith. Our experiences
of evil and suffering, injustice, and death, seem to contradict the
Good News; they can shake our faith and become a temptation 309
against it.
1502, 1 006
165
It is then we must turn to the witnesses offaith: to Abraham,
who "in hope . . . believed against hope" ;51 to the Virgin Mary, who,
in "her pilgrimage of faith," walked into the "night of faith" 52 in
sharing the darkness of her son's suffering and death; and to so 271 9
many others: "Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a
cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which
clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is
set before us, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our
faith." 53
ARTICLE 2

WE BELIEVE

166
Faith is a personal act - the free response of the human
person to the initiative of God who reveals himself. But faith is not 875
an isolated act. No one can believe alone, just as no one can live
alone. You have not given yourself faith as you have not given

yourself life. The believer has received faith from others and should
hand it on to others. Our love for Jesus and for our neighbor impels
us to speak to others about our faith. Each believer is thus a link in
the great chain of believers. I cannot believe without being carried
by the faith of others, and by my faith I help support others in the
faith.
167
"I believe" (Apostles' Creed) is the faith of the Church
1 124 professed personally by each believer, principally during Baptism.
"We believe" (Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed) is the faith of the
Church confessed by the bishops assembled in council or more
generally by the liturgical assembly of believers. "I believe" is also
the Church, our mother, responding to God by faith as she teaches
2040 us to say both "I believe" and "We believe."
I.

"LORD, LOOK UPON THE FAITH OF YOUR CHURCH"

168
It is the Church that believes first, and so bears, nourishes,
and sustains my faith. Everywhere, it is the Church that first
confesses the Lord: "Throughout the world the holy Church ac­
claims you," as we sing in the hymn "Te Deum"; with her and in
her, we are won over and brought to confess: "I believe," "We
believe. " It is through the Church that we receive faith and new life
in Christ by Baptism. In the Rituale Romanum, the minister of
Baptism asks the catechumen: "What do you ask of God's
1 253 Church?" And the answer is: "Faith." "What does faith offer you?"
"Etemal life." 54
169
Salvation comes from God alone; but because we receive
the life of faith through the Church, she is our mother: "We believe
the Church as the mother of our new birth, and not in the Church
750 as if she were the author of our salvation."55 Because she is our
2030 mother, she is also our teacher in the faith.
II.

THE LANGUAGE OF FAITH

170
We do not believe in formulas, but in those realities they
express, which faith allows us to touch. "The believer's act [of faith]
does not terminate in the propositions, but in the realities [which
they express]. "56 All the same, we do approach these realities with
186 the help of formulations of the faith which permit us to express the

faith and to hand it on, to celebrate it in community, to assimilate
and live on it more and more.
171
The Church, "the pillar and bulwark of the truth," faith- 78, 857, 84
fully guards "the faith which was once for all delivered to the 185
saints. " She guards the memory of Christ's words; it is she who
from generation to generation hands on the apostles' confession of
faith.57 As a mother who teaches her children to speak and so to
understand and communicate, the Church our Mother teaches us
the language of faith in order to introduce us to the understanding
and the life of faith.
III.

ONLY ONE FAITH

Through the centuries, in so many languages, cultures,
172
peoples, and nations, the Church has constantly confessed this one
faith, received from the one Lord, transmitted by one Baptism, and
grounded in the conviction that all people have only one God and 813
Father.58 St. Irenaeus of Lyons, a witness of this faith, declared:
173
"Indeed, the Church, though scattered throughout the
whole world, even to the ends of the earth, having received the
faith from the apostles and their disciples . . . guards [this preaching 830
and faith] with care, as dwelling in but a single house, and similarly
believes as if having but one soul and a single heart, and preaches,
teaches, and hands on this faith with a unanimous voice, as if
possessing only one mouth."59
174
"For though languages differ throughout the world, the
content of the Tradition is one and the same. The Churches estab­
lished in Germany have no other faith or Tradition, nor do those 78
of the Iberians, nor those of the Celts, nor those of the East, of Egypt,
of Libya, nor those established at the center of the world . . . . " 60 The
Church's message "is true and solid, in which one and the same
way of salvation appears throughout the whole world."61
175
"We guard with care the faith that we have received from
the Church, for without ceasing, under the action of God's Spirit,
this deposit of great price, as if in an excellent vessel, is constantly
being renewed and causes the very vessel that contains it to be
renewed." 62

Part One

IN BRIEF
176

Faith is a personal adherence of the whole man to God
who reveals himself. It involves an assent of the intel­
lect and will to the self-revelation God has made
through his deeds and words.

177

"To believe" has thus a twofold reference: to the per­
son and to the truth: to the truth, by trust in the person
who bears witness to it.

178

We must believe in no one but God: the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit.

179

Faith is a supernatural gift from God. In order to
believe, man needs the interior helps of the Holy Spirit.

180

"Believing" is a human act, conscious and free, corre­
sponding to the dignity of the human person.

181

"Believing" is an ecclesial act. The Church's faith pre­
cedes, engenders, supports, and nourishes our faith.
The Church is the mother of all believers. "No one can
have God as Father who does not have the Church as
Mother" (St. Cyprian, De unit. 6: PL 4, 519).

182

We believe all "that which is contained in the word of
God, written or handed down, and which the Church
proposes for belief as divinely revealed" (Paul VI,
CPG, § 20).

183

Faith is necessary for salvation. The Lord himself af­
firms: "He who believes and is baptized will be saved;
but he who does not believe will be condemned" (Mk
16:16).

184

"Faith is a foretaste of the knowledge that will make
us blessed in the life to come" (St. Thomas Aquinas,
Camp. theol. 1, 2).

SECTI ON TWO
THE PROFE SSION
OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH
T HE C REEDS

185
Whoever says "I believe" says "I pledge myself to what we
believe." Communion in faith needs a common language of faith, 1 71, 949
normative for all and uniting all in the same confession of faith.
186
From the beginning, the apostolic Church expressed and
handed on her faith in brief formulae for al1. 1 But already early on,
the Church also wanted to gather the essential elements of its faith
into organic and articulated summaries, intended especially for
candidates for Baptism:
This synthesis of faith was not made to accord with human
opinions, but rather what was of the greatest importance
was gathered from all the Scriptures, to present the one
teaching of the faith in its entirety. And just as the mustard
seed contains a great number of branches in a tiny grain, so
too this summary of faith encompassed in a few words the
whole knowledge of the true religion contained in the Old
2
and New Testaments.

187
Such syntheses are called "professions of faith" since they
summarize the faith that Christians profess. They are called
"creeds" on account of what is usually their first word in Latin:
credo ("I believe"). They are also called "symbols of faith. "
The Greek word sym bolo n meant half o f a broken object, for
example, a seal presented as a token of recognition. The broken parts were
placed together to verify the bearer's identity. The symbol of faith, then,
is a sign of recognition and communion between believers. Symbolon also
means a gathering, collection, or summary. A symbol of faith is a summary
of the principal truths of the faith and therefore serves as the first and
fundamental point of reference for catechesis.

188

The first "profession of faith" is made during Baptism. The
symbol of faith is first and foremost the baptismal creed. Since 1 237, 232
Baptism is given "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
the Holy Spirit,"3 the truths of faith professed during Baptism are

articulated in terms of their reference to the three persons of the
Holy Trinity.
190
And so the Creed is divided into three parts: "the first part
speaks of the first divine Person and the wonderful work of crea­
tion; the next speaks of the second divine Person and the mystery
of his redemption of men; the final part speaks of the third divine
Person, the origin and source of our sanctification."4 These are "the
three chapters of our [baptismal] seal."5
191
"These three parts are distinct although connected with
one another. According to a comparison often used by the Fathers,
we call them articles. Indeed, just as in our bodily members there
are certain articulations which distinguish and separate them, so
too in this profession of faith, the name articles has justly and rightly
been given to the truths we must believe particularly and dis­
tinctly." 6 In accordance with an ancient tradition, already attested
to by St. Ambrose, it is also customary to reckon the articles of the
Creed as twelve, thus symbolizing the fullness of the apostolic faith
by the number of the apostles. 7
192
Through the centuries many professions or symbols of
faith have been articulated in response to the needs of the different
eras: the creeds of the different apostolic and ancient Churches,8
e.g., the Quicumque, also called the Athanasian Creed;9 the profes­
sions of faith of certain Councils, such as Toledo, Lateran, Lyons,
Trent; 10 or the symbols of certain popes, e.g., the Fides Damasi11 or
the Credo of the People of God of Paul VI . 1 2
193
None of the creeds from the difference stages in the
Church's life can be considered superseded or irrelevant. They help
us today to attain and deepen the faith of all times by means of the
different summaries made of it.

Among all the creeds, two occupy a special place in the
Church's life:

11 Cf. OS 71-72.

The Profession of Faith

53

194
The Apostles' Creed is so called because it is rightly consid­
ered to be a faithful summary of the apostles' faith. It is the ancient
baptismal symbol of the Church of Rome. Its great authority arises
from this fact: it is " the Creed of the Roman Church, the See of Peter,
the first of the apostles, to which he brought the common faith." 1 3
195
The Niceno-Constantinopolitan or Nicene Creed draws its
great authority from the fact that it stems from the first two ecu­
menical Councils (in 325 and 381). It remains common to all the 242, 245,
great Churches of both East and West to this day.
465
196
Our presentation of the faith will follow the Apostles'
Creed, which constitutes, as it were, "the oldest Roman catechism."
The presentation will be completed however by constant refer­
ences to the Nicene Creed which is often more explicit and more
detailed.
197
As on the day of our Baptism, when our whole life was
entrusted to the " standard of teaching," 1 4 let us embrace the Creed 1064
of our life-giving faith. To say the Credo with faith is to enter into
communion with God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and also with
the whole Church which transmits the faith to us and in whose
midst we believe:
This Creed is the spiritual seal, our hearts's meditation and
an ever-present guardian; it is, unquestionably, the treasure
of our soul. l5

C HAPTER ONE
I B ELIEVE IN Goo THE FATHER

198
Our profession of faith begins with God, for God is the First
and the Last,1 the beginning and the end of everything. The Credo
begins with God the Father, for the Father is the first divine person
of the Most Holy Trinity; our Creed begins with the creation of
heaven and earth, for creation is the beginning and the foundation
of all God's works.
ARTICLE 1
"I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY,
CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH"
Paragraph 1 . I Believe in God

199
"I believe in God": this first affirmation of the Apostles'
Creed is also the most fundamental. The whole Creed speaks of
God, and when it also speaks of man and of the world it does so in
relation to God. The other articles of the Creed all depend on the
first, just as the remaining Commandments make the first explicit.
2083 The other articles help us to know God better as he revealed himself
progressively to men. "The faithful first profess their belief in
God." 2
I.

"I B ELIEVE IN ONE Goo"

200
These are the words with which the Niceno-Constanti­
nopolitan Creed begins. The confession of God's oneness, which
2085 has its roots in the divine revelation of the Old Covenant, is
inseparable from the profession of God's existence and is equally
fundamental. God is unique; there is only one God: "The Christian
faith confesses that God is one in nature, substance, and essence. "3
201
To Israel, his chosen, God revealed himself as the only One:
2083 "Hear, 0 Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD; and you shall love
the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and
with all your might. " 4 Through the prophets, God calls Israel and

all nations to tum to him, the one and only God: "Tum to me and
be saved, all the ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no
other . . . . To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.
'Only in the LORD, it shall be said of me, are righteousness and
strength.'"5
202
Jesus himself affirms that God is "the one Lord" whom you
must love "with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all
your mind, and with all your strength." 6 At the same time Jesus
gives us to understand that he himself is "the Lord." 7 To confess 446
that Jesus is Lord is distinctive of Christian faith. This is not
contrary to belief in the One God. Nor does believing in the Holy
Spirit as "Lord and giver of life" introduce any division into the 1 52
One God:
We firmly believe and confess without reservation that there
is only one true God, eternal, infinite (immensus) and un­
changeable, incomprehensible, almighty, and ineffable, the
Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit; three persons indeed,
but one essence, substance or nature entirely simple. 8

Goo REVEALS HIS NAME

203
God revealed himself to his people Israel by making his
name known to them. A name expresses a person's essence and
identity and the meaning of this person's life. God has a name; he 2143
is not an anonymous force. To disclose one's name is to make
oneself known to others; in a way it is to hand oneself over by
becoming accessible, capable of being known more intimately and
addressed personally.
204
God revealed himself progressively and under different
names to his people, but the revelation that proved to be the
fundamental one for both the Old and the New Covenants was the
revelation of the divine name to Moses in the theophany of the 63
burning bush, on the threshold of the Exodus and of the covenant
on Sinai.

5 Isa 45: 22-24; cf. Phi/ 2:10-1 1 .
6 Mk 12:29-30.
7 Cf. Mk 12:35-37.
8 Lateran Council IV: OS 800.

56

Part One

The living God
205
God calls Moses from the midst of a bush that burns
without being consumed: "I am the God of your father, the God of
2575 Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.''9 God is the God
of the fathers, the One who had called and guided the patriarchs
in their wanderings. He is the faithful and compassionate God who
remembers them and his promises; he comes to free their descen­
dants from slavery. He is the God who, from beyond space and
268 time, can do this and wills to do it, the God who will put his
almighty power to work for this plan.
"I Am who I Am"
Moses said to God, "If I come to the people of Israel and say
to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you', and
they ask me, 'What is his name?' what shall I say to them?"
God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM." And he said, "Say this
to the people of Israel, 'I Am has sent me to you' . . . this is
my name for ever, and thus I am to be remembered through­
out all generations." 10

In revealing his mysterious name, YHWH ("I AM HE WHO
206
Is," "I AM WHO AM" or "I AM WHO I AM"), God says who he is and
by what name he is to be called. This divine name is mysterious
just as God is mystery. It is at once a name revealed and something
like the refusal of a name, and hence it better expresses God as what
he is - infinitely above everything that we can understand or say:
he is the "hidden God," his name is ineffable, and he is the God
43 who makes himself close to men.ll

By revealing his name God at the same time reveals his
207
faithfulness which is from everlasting to everlasting, valid for the
past ("I am the God of your fathers"), as for the future ("I will be
with you"). 1 2 God, who reveals his name as "I AM," reveals himself
as the God who is always there, present to his people in order to
save them.
Faced with God's fascinating and mysterious presence,
man discovers his own insignificance. Before the burning bush,
Moses takes off his sandals and veils his face in the presence of
God's holiness. 13 Before the glory of the thrice-holy God, Isaiah

cries out: "Woe is me! I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips. " l4
Before the divine signs wrought by Jesus, Peter exclaims: "Depart
from me, for I am a sinful man, 0 Lord ." 15 But because God is holy, 448
he can forgive the man who realizes that he is a sinner before him:
"I will not execute my fierce anger . . . for I am God and not man,
the Holy One in your midst." 16 The apostle John says likewise: "We 3 88
shall . . . reassure our hearts before him whenever our hearts
condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows
everything. " 1 7

209
Out of respect for the holiness of God, the people of Israel do not
pronounce his name. In the reading of Sacred Scripture, the revealed name
(YHWH) is replaced by the divine title "LoRD" (in Hebrew Adonai, in Greek
Kyrios). It is under this title that the divinity of Jesus will be acclaimed:
"Jesus is LORD."

446

"A God merciful and gracious"
After Israel's sin, when the people had turned away from
God to worship the golden calf, God hears Moses' prayer of intercession and agrees to walk in the midst of an unfaithful people, 2 1 1 6, 2577
thus demonstrating his love.l 8 When Moses asks to see his glory,
God responds "I will make all my goodness pass before you, and
will proclaim before you my name ' the LORD' [YHWH] . " 19 Then the
LORD passes before Moses and proclaims, "YHWH, YHWH, a God
merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast
love and faithfulness"; Moses then confesses that the LORD is a
forgiving God.20

210

The divine name, "I Am" or "He Is," expresses God's
211
faithfulness: despite the faithlessness of men's sin and the punish­
ment it deserves, he keeps "steadfast love for thousands." 21 By
going so far as to give up his own Son for us, God reveals that he 604
is "rich in mercy."22 By giving his life to free us from sin, Jesus
reveals that he himself bears the divine name: "When you have
lifted up the Son of man, then you will realize that 'I Am."' 23

Part One

God alone IS
212
Over the centuries, Israel's faith was able to manifest and
deepen realization of the riches contained in the revelation of the
divine name. God is nnique; there are no other gods besides him. 24
He transcends the world and history. He made heaven and earth:
42 "They will perish, but you endure; they will all wear out like a
garment . . . but you are the same, and your years have no end. " 2S
469, 2086 In God "there is no variation or shadow due to change. "26 God is
"He who Is," from everlasting to everlasting, and as such remains
ever faithful to himself and to his promises.
213
The revelation of the ineffable name "I Am who Am"
contains then the truth that God alone IS. The Greek Septuagint
translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, and following it the Church's
Tradition, nnderstood the divine name in this sense: God is the
fullness of Being and of every perfection, without origin and
41 without end. All creatures receive all that they are and have from
him; but he alone is his very being, and he is of himself everything
that he is.

III.

Goo, "HE WHo Is," Is TRUTH AND LovE

214
God, "He who is," revealed himself to Israel as the one
"abonnding in steadfast love and faithfulness." 27 These two terms
express summarily the riches of the divine name. In all his works
1 062 God displays not only his kindness, goodness, grace, and steadfast
love, but also his trustworthiness, constancy, faithfulness, and
truth. "I give thanks to your name for your steadfast love and your
faithfulness." 2 8 He is the Truth, for "God is light and in him there
is no darkness"; "God is love," as the apostle John teaches.29

God is truth
215
"The sum of your word is truth; and every one of your
righteous ordinances endures forever. "3° "And now, 0 LORD God,
you are God, and your words are true;" 31 this is why God's 2465
promises always come true. 32 God is Truth itself, whose words 1 063, 1 56
cannot deceive. This is why one can abandon oneself in full trust
to the truth and faithfulness of his word in all things. The beginning
of sin and of man's fall was due to a lie of the tempter who induced
doubt of God's word, kindness, and faithfulness.
397
216
God's truth is his wisdom, which commands the whole
created order and governs the world. 33 God, who alone made 295
heaven and earth, can alone impart true knowledge of every ere- 32
ated thing in relation to himself. 34
217
God is also truthful when he reveals himself - the teaching
that comes from God is "true instruction." 35 When he sends his Son
into the world it will be "to bear witness to the truth": 36 "We know
that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, to 851
2466
know him who is true." 37
God is love
In the course of its history, Israel was able to discover that
God had only one reason to reveal himself to them, a single motive
for choosing them from among all peoples as his special posses­
sion: his sheer gratuitous love. 38 And thanks to the prophets Israel 295
understood that it was again out of love that God never stopped
saving them and pardoning their unfaithfulness and sins. 39
218

God's love for Israel is compared to a father's love for his 239
son. His love for his people is stronger than a mother's for her 796, 458
children. God loves his people more than a bridegroom his beloved; his love will be victorious over even the worst infidelities

that he gave his only Son." 40
God's love is "everlasting": 41 "For the mountains may
depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not
depart from you." 42 Through Jeremiah, God declares to his people,
"I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have con­
tinued my faithfulness to you." 43

220

221
But St. John goes even further when he affirms that "God
733 is love": 44 God's very being is love. By sending his only Son and
851 the Spirit of Love in the fullness of time, God has revealed his
257 innermost secret: 45 God himself is an eternal exchange of love,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and he has destined us to share in that
exchange.

everything we are and have comes from him: "What have you that

356, 360 225
It means knowing the unity and true dignity of all men: Every1 700, 1 934 one is made in the image and likeness of God.so

It means making good use of created things: faith in God, the

"Hear, 0 Israel, the LORD our God is one LORD . . . "
(Deut 6:4; Mk 12:29). "The supreme being must be
unique, without equal . . . . If God is not one, he is not
God" (Tertullian, Adv. Marc., 1, 3, 5: PL 2, 274).

229

Faith in God leads us to tum to him alone as our first
origin and our ultimate goal, and neither to prefer
anything to him nor to substitute anything for him.

230

Even when he reveals himself, God remains a mystery
beyond words: "If you understood him, it would not
be God" (St. Augustine, Sermo 52, 6, 16: PL 38:360 and
Sermo 117, 3,5: PL 38, 663).

The God of our faith has revealed himself as He who
is; and he has made himself known as "abounding in
steadfast love and faithfulness" (Ex 34:6). God's very
being is Truth and Love.

Paragraph 2 . The Father

I.

"IN THE NAME O F THE FATHER AND OF THE SON
AND oF THE HotY SPIRIT"

232
Christians are baptized "in the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Spirit."53 Before receiving the sacrament,
1 89, 1 22 3 they respond to a three-part question when asked to confess the
Father, the Son, and the Spirit: "I do." "The faith of all Christians
rests on the Trinity."54
233
Christians are baptized in the name of the Father and of the
Son and of the Holy Spirit: not in their names,55 for there is only one
God, the almighty Father, his only Son, and the Holy Spirit: the
Most Holy Trinity.
The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity is the central mystery
of Christian faith and life. It is the mystery of God in himself. It is
2157 therefore the source of all the other mysteries of faith, the light that
enlightens them. It is the most fundamental and essential teaching
in the "hierarchy of the truths of faith."56 The whole history of
90 salvation is identical with the history of the way and the means by
1 449 which the one true God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, reveals
himself to men "and reconciles and unites with himself those who
tum away from sin." 57

234

235
This paragraph expounds briefly (I) how the mystery of
the Blessed Trinity was revealed, (II) how the Church has articu­
lated the doctrine of the faith regarding this mystery, and (III) how,
by the divine missions of the Son and the Holy Spirit, God the
Father fulfills the "plan of his loving goodness" of creation, re­
demption, and sanctification.
236
The Fathers of the Church distinguish between theology (theolo­
1 066 gia) and economy (oikonomia). "Theology" refers to the mystery of God's

259

inmost life within the Blessed Trinity and "economy" to all the works by
which God reveals himself and communicates his life. Through the oik­
onomia the theologia is revealed to us; but conversely, the tl!eologia il lumi­
nates the whole oikonomia. God's works reveal who he is in himself; the
mystery of his inmost being enlightens our understanding of all his works.
So it is, analogously, among human persons. A person discloses himself

in his actions, and the better we know a person, the better we understand
his actions.

The Trinity is a mystery of faith in the strict sense, one of 50
the "mysteries that are hidden in God, which can never be known
unless they are revealed by God ."58 To be sure, God has left traces
of his Trinitarian being in his work of creation and in his Revelation
throughout the Old Testament. But his inmost Being as Holy
Trinity is a mystery that is inaccessible to reason alone or even to
Israel's faith before the Incarnation of God's Son and the sending
of the Holy Spirit.

237

II.

THE REVELATION OF Goo AS TRINITY

The Father revealed by the Son
Many religions invoke God as "Father." The deity is often
considered the "father of gods and of men." In Israel, God is called
"Father" inasmuch as he is Creator of the world . 59 Even more, God
is Father because of the covenant and the gift of the law to Israel,
"his first-born son."60 God is also called the Father of the king of
Israel. Most especially he is "the Father of the poor," of the or­
phaned and the widowed, who are under his loving protection. 61 2443

238

239

By calling God "Father," the language of faith indicates hvo main
things: that God is the first origin of everything and transcendent authority; and that he is at the same time goodness and loving care for all his
children. God's parental tenderness can a lso be expressed by the image of
motherhood,62 which emphasizes God's immanence, the intimacy beh\ieen Creator and creature. The language of faith thus d raws on the
human experience of parents, who are in a way the first representatives of
God for man. But this experience also tells us that human parents are
fallible and can disfigure the face of fatherhood and motherhood. We
ought therefore to recall that God transcends the human distinction beh\ieen the sexes. He is neither man nor woman: he is God . He also
transcends human fatherhood and motherhood, although he is their origin
and standard: 63 no one is father as God is Father.

370, 2 779

240
Jesus revealed that God is Father in an unheard-of sense:
he is Father not only in being Creator; he is eternally Father in
relation to his only Son, who is eternally Son only in relation to his 2780
Father: "No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one 441-445

knows the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son
chooses to reveal him." 64
For this reason the apostles confess Jesus to be the Word :
"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God"; as " the image of the invisible God"; as the
"radiance of the glory of God and the very s tamp of his nature ."65

241

Following this apostolic tradition, the Church confessed at
242
the first ecumenical council at Nicaea (325) that the Son is "consub­
s tantial" with the Father, that is, one only God with him. 66 The
465 second ecumenical council , held at Constantinople in 381, kept this
expression in its formulation of the Nicene Creed and confessed
"the only-begotten Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father,
light from light, true God from true God, begotten not made,
consubstantial with the Father. "67

The Father and the Son revealed by the Spirit
243
Before his Passover, Jesus announced the sending of "an683 other Paraclete" (Advocate), the Holy Spirit. At work since crea­
tion, having previously "spoken through the prophets," the Spirit
2780 will now be with and in the disciples, to teach them and guide them
687 "into all the truth."68 The Holy Spirit is thus revealed as another
divine person with Jesus and the Father.
The eternal origin of the Holy Spirit is revealed in his
mission in time. The Spirit is sent to the apostles and to the Church
both by the Father in the name of the Son, and by the Son in person,
once he had returned to the Father. 69 The sending of the person of
the Spirit after Jesus' glorification70 reveals in its fullness the mys732 tery of the Holy Trinity.

244

The apostolic faith concerning the Spirit was confessed by
the second ecumenical council at Constantinople (381): "We be­

from the Father. " 71 By this confession, the Chu rch recognizes the

Father as "the source and origin of the whole divinity. " 72 But the
eternal origin of the Spirit is not unconnected with the Son's origin:
"The Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, is God, one and
equal with the Father and the Son, of the same substance and also
of the same nature . . . . Yet he is not called the Spirit of the Father
alone, . . . but the Spirit of both the Father and the Son." 73 The Creed
of the Church from the Council of Constantinople confesses: "With
the Father and the Son, he is worshipped and glorified." 74
685
The Latin tradition of the Creed confesses that the Spirit
"proceeds from the Father and the Son (jilioque)." The Council of
Florence in 1438 explains: "The Holy Spirit is eternally from Father
and Son; He has his nature and subsistence at once (simul) from the
Father and the Son. He proceeds eternally from both as from one
principle and through one spiration . . . . And, since the Father has
through generation given to the only-begotten Son everything that
belongs to the Father, except being Father, the Son has also eter­
nally from the Father, from whom he is eternally born, that the
Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son." 75

246

247
The affirmation of the filioque does not appear in the Creed
confessed in 381 at Constantinople. But Pope St. Leo I, following an ancient
Latin and Alexandrian tradition, had already confessed it dogmatically in
447,76 even before Rome, in 451 at the Council of Chalcedon, came to
recognize and receive the Symbol of 381 . The use of this formula in the
Creed was gradually admitted into the Latin liturgy (between the eighth
and eleventh centuries). The introduction of the filioque into the Niceno­
Constantinopolitan Creed by the Latin liturgy constitutes moreover, even
today, a point of disagreement with the Orthodox Churches.
248

At the outset the Eastern tradition expresses the Father's charac­
ter as first origin of the Spirit. By confessing the Spirit as he "who proceeds
from the Father," it affirms that he comesfrom the Father through the Son ?7
The Western tradition expresses first the consubstantial communion be­
tween Father and Son, by saying that the Spirit proceeds from the Father
and the Son ifilioque). It says this, "legitimately and with good reason," 78
for the eternal order of the divine persons in their consubstantial commun­
ion implies that the Father, as "the principle without principle," 79 is the
first origin of the Spirit, but also that as Father of the only Son, he is with
6
the Son, the single principle from which the Holy Spirit proceeds. 8 This

legitimate complementarity, provided it does not become rigid, does not

Ill.

THE

HOLY T RINITY IN THE TEACHING OF THE FAITH

The formation of the Trinitarian dogma
249
From the beginning, the revealed truth of the Holy Trinity
has been at the very root of the Church's living faith, principally
683 by means of Baptism. It finds its expression in the rule of baptismal
1 89 faith, formulated in the preaching, catechesis, and prayer of the
Church. Such formulations are already found in the apostolic
writings, such as this salutation taken up in the Eucharistic liturgy:
"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the
fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you ali." 81
250
During the first centuries the Church sought to clarify its
Trinitarian faith, both,to deepen its own understanding of the faith
94 and to defend it against the errors that were deforming it. This
clarification was the work of the early councils, aided by the
theological work of the Church Fathers and sustained by the
Christian people's sense of the faith.

1 70

251
In order to articulate the dogma of the Trinity, the Church had to
develop its own terminology with the help of certain notions of philosophi­
cal origin: "substance," "person" or "hypostasis," "relation," and so on. In
doing this, she did not submit the faith to human wisdom, but gave a new
and unprecedented meaning to these terms, which from then on would be
used to signify an ineffable mystery, "infinitely beyond all that we can
humanly understand." 82
252
The Church uses (I) the term "substance" (rendered also
at times by "essence" or "nature") to designate the divine being in
its unity, (II) the term "person" or "hypostasis" to designate the
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in the real distinction among them,
and (III) the term "relation" to designate the fact that their distinc­
tion lies in the relationship of each to the others.
The dogma of the Holy Trinity

253
The Trinity is One. We do not confess three Gods, but one
2 789 God in three persons, the "consubstantial Trinity." 83 The divine
persons do not share the one divinity among themselves but each

of them is God whole and entire: "The Father is that which the Son
is, the Son that which the Father is, the Father and the Son that
which the Holy Spirit is, i.e., by nature one God." 84 In the words
of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215): "Each of the persons is that
supreme reality, viz., the divine substance, essence or nature." 85
590

The divine persons are really distinct from one another. "God is
one but not solitary." 86 "Father," "Son," "Holy Spirit" are not
simply names designating modalities of the divine being, for they 468, 689
are really distinct from one another: "He is not the Father who is
the Son, nor is the Son he who is the Father, nor is the Holy Spirit
he who is the Father or the Son." 87 They are distinct from one
another in their relations of origin: "It is the Father who generates,
the Son who is begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds."88 The
divine Unity is Triune.
254

255
The divine persons are relative to one another. Because it does
not divide the divine unity, the real distinction of the persons from
one another resides solely in the relationships which relate them to
one another: "In the relational names of the persons the Father is
related to the Son, the Son to the Father, and the Holy Spirit to both.
While they are called three persons in view of their relations, we 240
believe in one nature or substance." 89 Indeed " everything (in them)
is one where there is no opposition of relationship ." 90 "Because of
that unity the Father is wholly in the Son and wholly in the Holy
Spirit; the Son is wholly in the Father and wholly in the Holy Spirit;
the Holy Spirit is wholly in the Father and wholly in the Son." 91
St. Gregory of Nazianzus, also called "the Theologian,"
entrusts this summary of Trinitarian faith to the catechumens of 236, 684
84

256

Above all guard for me this great deposit of faith for which

THE DIVINE WORKS AND THE TRINITARIAN MISSIONS

257
"0 blessed light, 0 Trinity and first Unity!" 93 God is
eternal blessedness, undying life, unfading light. God is love:
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God freely wills to communicate the
glory of his blessed life. Such is the "plan of his loving kindness,"
conceived by the Father before the foundation of the world, in his
beloved Son: "He destined us in love to be his sons" and "to be
conformed to the image of his Son," through "the spirit of son­
ship." 94 This plan is a "grace [which] was given to us in Christ Jesus
before the ages began," stemming immediately from Trinitarian
love. 95 It unfolds in the work of creation, the whole history of
salvation after the fall, and the missions of the Son and the Spirit,
which are continued in the mission of the Church. 96

258
The whole divine economy is the common work of the
three divine persons. For as the Trinity has only one and the same
nature, so too does it have only one and the same operation: "The
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are not three principles of
686 creation but one principle. " 97 However each divine person per­
forms the common work according to his unique personal prop­
erty. Thus the Church confesses, following the New Testament,
"one God and Father from whom all things are, and one Lord Jesus
Christ, through whom all things are, and one Holy Spirit in whom
all things are. "98 It is above all the divine missions of the Son's
Incarnation and the gift of the Holy Spirit that show forth the
properties of the divine persons.

259
Being a work at once common and personal, the whole 236
divine economy makes known both what is proper to the divine
persons and their one divine nature. Hence the whole Christian life
is a commrmion with each of the divine persons, without in any
way separating them. Everyone who glorifies the Father does so
through the Son in the Holy Spirit; everyone who follows Christ
does so because the Father draws him and the Spirit moves him. 99
260
The ultimate end of the whole divine economy is the entry
of God's creatures into the perfect rmity of the Blessed Trinity. l OO
But even now we are called to be a dwelling for the Most Holy 1 050, 1 72 1
Trinity: "If a man loves me," says the Lord, "he will keep m y word, 1 997
and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make
our home with him " : 101
0 my God, Trinity whom I adore, help me forget myself
entirely so to establish myself in you, unmovable and peaceful as if my soul were already in eternity. May nothing be
able to trouble my peace or make me leave you, 0 my
unchanging God, but may each minute bring me more
deeply into your mystery! Grant my soul peace. Make it your
heaven, your beloved dwelling and the place of your rest.
May I never abandon you there, but may I be there, whole
and entire, completely vigilant in my faith, entirely adoring,
and wholly given over to your creative action. 102

IN B RIEF
261

The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity is the central
mystery of the Christian faith and of Christian life.
God alone can make it known to us by revealing
himself as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

262

The Incarnation of God's Son reveals that God is the
eternal Father and that the Son is consubstantial with
the Father, which means that, in the Father and with
the Father, the Son is one and the same God.

263

The mission of the Holy Spirit, sent by the Father in
the name of the Son an 14:26) and by the Son "from
the Father" an 15:26), reveals that, with them, the
Spirit is one and the same God. "With the Father and

the Son he is worshipped and glorified" (Nicene
Creed).

264

"The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father as the first
principle and, by the eternal gift of this to the Son, from
the communion of both the Father and the Son" (St.
Augustine, De Trin. 1 5, 26, 47: PL 42: 1095).

265

By the grace of Baptism "in the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit," we are called to
share in the life of the Blessed Trinity, here on earth in
the obscurity of faith, and after death in eternal light
(Cf. Paul VI, CPG § 9).

266

"Now this is the Catholic faith: We worship one God
in the Trinity and the Trinity in unity, without either
confusing the persons or dividing the substance; for
the person of the Father is one, the Son's is another, the
Holy Spirit's another; but the Godhead of the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit is one, their glory equal, their
majesty coeternal" (Athanasian Creed; OS 75; NO 16).

267

Inseparable in what they are, the divine persons are
also inseparable in what they do. But within the single
divine operation each shows forth what is proper to
him in the Trinity, especially in the divine missions of
the Son's Incarnation and the gift of the Holy Spirit.

Paragraph 3. The Almighty

268
Of all the divine attributes, only God's omnipotence is
named in the Creed: to confess this power has great bearing on our
lives. We believe that his might is universal, for God who created 222
everything also rules everything and can do everything. God's
power is loving, for he is our Father, and mysterious, for only faith
can discern it when it "is made perfect in weakness." 1 03
"He does whatever he pleases" 1 04
The Holy Scriptures repeatedly confess the universal
power of God. He is called the "Mighty One of Jacob," the "LORD
of hosts," the "strong and mighty" one. If God is almighty "in
heaven and on earth," it is because he made them. l 05 Nothing is
impossible with God, who disposes his works according to his
will.l 06 He is the Lord of the universe, whose order he established
and which remains wholly subj ect to him and at his disposal. He 303
is master of history, governing hearts and events in keeping with
his will: "It is always in your power to show great strength, and
who can withstand the strength of your arm?" 107

269

"You are merciful to all, for you can do all things"1 08
270
God is the Father Almighty, whose fatherhood and power
shed light on one another: God reveals his fatherly omnipotence
by the way he takes care of our needs; by the filial adoption that he 2 777
gives us ("I will be a father to you, and you shall be my sons and
daughters, says the Lord Almighty."): 1 09 finally by his infinite
mercy, for he displays his power at its height by freely forgiving
sins.
1 441
271
God's almighty power is in no way arbitrary: "In God,
power, essence, will, intellect, wisdom, and justice are all identical.
Nothing therefore can be in God's power which could not be in his
just will or his wise intellect."llO

272
Faith in God the Father Almighty can be put to the test by
the experience of evil and suffering. God can sometimes seem to
be absent and incapable of stopping evil. But in the most mysteri­
ous way God the Father has revealed his almighty power in the
voluntary humiliation and Resurrection of his Son, by which he
conquered evil. Christ crucified is thus "the power of God and the
wisdom of God. For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and
the weakness of God is stronger than men." 111 It is in Christ's
Resurrection and exaltation that the Father has shown forth "the
immeasurable greatness of his power in us who believe." 112

Only faith can embrace the mysterious ways of God's
almighty power. This faith glories in its weaknesses in order to
1 48 draw to itself Christ's power. 113 The Virgin Mary is the supreme
model of this faith, for she believed that "nothing will be impossi­
ble with God," and was able to magnify the Lord: "For he who is
mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name." 1 14

273

274
"Nothing is more apt to confirm our faith and hope than
holding it fixed in our minds that nothing is impossible with God.
1814, 1 8 1 7 Once our reason has grasped the idea of God's almighty power, it
will easily and without any hesitation admit everything that [the
Creed] will afterwards propose for us to believe - even if they be
great and marvellous things, far above the ordinary laws of na­
ture." 115

IN BRIEF
275

With Job, the just man, we confess: " I know that you
can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be
thwarted" (Job 42:2).

276

Faithful to the witness of Scripture, the Church often
addresses its prayer to the "almighty and eternal God"
(" omnipotens sempiteme Deus . . . "), believing firmly
that "nothing will be impossible with God" (Gen 18:14;

Lk 1:37; Mt 19:26).

God shows forth his almighty power by converting us
from our sins and restoring us to his friendship by
grace. "God, you show your almighty power above all
in your mercy and forgiveness . " (Roman Missal, 26th
Sunday, Opening Prayer).
. .

278

If we do not believe that God's love is almighty, how
can we believe that the Father could create us, the Son
redeem us, and the Holy Spirit sanctify us?

Paragraph 4. The Creator

279
"In the beginning God created the heavens and the
earth." l l 6 Holy Scripture begins with these solemn words. The
profession of faith takes them up when it confesses that God the
Father almighty is "Creator of heaven and earth" (Apostles' Creed),
"of all that is, seen and unseen" (Nicene Creed). We shall speak first
of the Creator, then of creation, and finally of the fall into sin from
which Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came to raise us up again.
Creation is the foundation of " all God's saving plans," the
"beginning of the history of salvation" 1 1 7 that culminates in Christ. 288
Conversely, the mystery of Christ casts conclusive light on the
mystery of creation and reveals the end for which "in the beginning 1 043
God created the heavens and the earth": from the beginning, God
envisaged the glory of the new creation in Christ. ll 8

280

281
And so the readings of the Easter Vigil, the celebration of the. new
�t, begin with the creation account; likewise in the Byzantine liturgy, the account of creation always constitutes the first reading at
the vigils of the great feasts of the Lord. According to ancient witnesses the
instruction of catechumens for Baptism followed the same itinerary . 11 9

C ATECHESIS ON C REATION

men of all times have asked themselves: 120 "Where do we come
from?" "Where are we going?" "What is our origin?" "What is our
end?" "Where does everything that exists come from and where is
it going?" The two questions, the first about the origin and the
second about the end, are inseparable. They are decisive for the
1 730 meaning and orientation of our life and actions.

283

1 59
341

The question about the origins of the world and of man has been
the object of many scientific studies which have splendidly enriched our
knowledge of the age and dimensions of the cosmos, the development of
life-forms and the appearance of man. These discoveries invite us to even
greater admiration for the greatness of the Creator, prompting us to give
him thanks for all his works and for the understanding and wisdom he
gives to scholars and researchers. With Solomon they can say: "It is he who
gave me unerring knowledge of what exists, to know the structure of the
world and the activi of the elements . . . for wisdom, the fashioner of all
things, taught me.'' 1

�

284
The great interest accorded to these studies is strongly stimulated
by a question of another order, which goes beyond the proper domain of
the natural sciences. It is not only a question of knowing when and how
the universe arose physically, or when man appeared, but rather of dis­
covering the ll}eanil}g of S):l �origin: is the universe governed by
chance, blind fate, anonymous necessity, or by a transcendent, intelligent
and good Being called "God"? And if the world does come from God's
wisdom and goodness, why is th��vil? Where does it come from? Who
is responsible for it? Is there any liberation from it?

295

28

285
Since the beginning the Christian faith has been challenged by
responses to the question of origins that differ from its own. Ancient
religions and cultures produced many myths concerning origins. Some
philosophers have said that everything is God, that the world is God, or
that the development of the world is the development of God (Pa!ltheism).
Others have said that the world is a necessary emanation arising from God
and returning to him. Still others have affirmed the existence of two eternal
principles, Good and Evil, Light and Darkness, locked in permanent
conflict (Du�li�m, MaJlichaE!ism). According to some of these conceptions,
the world (at least the physical world) is evil, the product of a fall, and is
thus to be rejected or left behind (Gn�tigsm). Some admit that the world
was made by God, but as by a watchmaker who, once he has made a watch,
abandons it to itself (Deism). Finally, others reject any transcendent origin
for the world, but see rras merely the interplay of matter that has always
existed (Materialism) . All these attempts bear witness to the permanence
and universality of the question of origins. This inquiry is distinctively
human.

120 Cf. NA 2.
121 Wis 7:17-22.

The Profession of Faith

75

Human intelligence is surely already capable of finding a 32
response to the question of origins. The existence of God the
Creator can be known with certainty through his works, by the
light of human reason, 122 even if this know ledge is often obscured
and disfigured by error. This is why faith comes to confirm and
enlighten reason in the correct understanding of this truth: "By 3 7
faith w e understand that the world was created b y the word of
God, so that what is seen was made out of things which do not
appear." 123

286

287
The truth about creation is so important for all of human
life that God in his tenderness wanted to reveal to his People
everything that is salutary to know on the subject. Beyond the 1 07
natural knowledge that every man can have of the Creator, 124 God
progressively revealed to Israel the mystery of creation. He who
chose the patriarchs, who brought Israel out of Egypt, and who by
choosing Israel created and formed it, this same God reveals himself
as the One to whom belong all the peoples of the earth, and the whole
earth itself; he is the One who alone "made heaven and earth."1 25
288
Thus the revelation of creation is inseparable from the
revelation and forging of the cov_enant of the one God with his
People . Creation is revealed as the first step toward this covenant, 280, 2569
the first and universal witness to God's all-powerful love. 126 And
so, the truth of creation is also expressed with growing vigor in the
message of the prophets, the prayer of the psalms and the liturgy,
and in the wisdom sayings of the Chosen People. 127
Among all the Scriptural texts about creation, the first
three chapters of Genesis occupy a unique place. From a literary 390
standpoint these texts may have had diverse sources. The inspired
authors have placed them at the beginning of Scripture to express
in their solemn language the truths of creation - its origin and its
end in God, its order and goodness, the vocation of man, and finally
the drama of sin and the hope of salvation. Read in the light of
Christ, within the unity of Sacred Scripture and in the living 1 1 1
Tradition of the Church, these texts remain the principal source for
catechesis on the mysteries of the "beginning": creation, falC and
promise of salvation.

CREATION - WORK OF THE HOLY TRINITY

II.

290
" In the beginning God created the heavens and the
earth" :128 three things are affirmed in these first words of Scripture:
the eternal God gave a beginn ing to all that exists outside of
himself; he alone is Creator (the verb "create" - Hebrew bara 326 always has God for its subject). The totality of what exists (ex­
pressed by the formula "the heavens and the earth") depends on
the One who gives it being.
"In the beginning was the Word . . . and the Word was God

291

. . . all things were made through him, and without him was not
241 anything made that was made. " 129 The New Testament reveals
that God created everything by the eternal Word, his beloved Son.
In him all things were Created, in heaven and Oft earth all things
331 were created through him and for him. He is before all things, and
in him all things hold together." 130 The Cllurch's faith likewise
703 confesses the creative action of the Holy Spirit, the "giver of life,"
"the Creator Spirit" (" Veni, Creator Spiritus"), the "source of every
good." 131
• • •

The Old Testament suggests and the New Covenant re­
veals the creative action of the Son and the Spirit, 132 inseparably
one with that of the Father. This creative cooperation is clearly
affirme d in the Church's rule of faith: "There exists but one God . . .
he is the Father, God, the Creator, the author, the giver of order. He
made all things by himself, that is, by his Word and by his Wisdom,"
699 "by the Son and the Spirit" who, so to speak, are "his hands. " 133

for God has no other reason for creating than his love and good­
ness: "Creatures came into existence when the key of love opened
his hand." 136 The First Vatican Council explains:
This one, true God, of his own goodness and "almighty
power," not for increasing his own beatitude, nor for attaining his perfection, but in order to manifest this perfection
through the benefits which he bestows on creatures, with
absolute freedom of counsel "and from the beginning of
time, made out of nothing both orders of creatures, the

thus simultaneously assuring his own glory and our beatitude." 140

THE MYSTERY OF CREATION

God creates by wisdom and love
295
We believe that God created the world according to his
wisdom. 141 It is not the product of any necessity whatever, nor of
blind fate or chance. We believe that it proceeds from God's free
will; he wanted to makg_his cre�tures share in bis._being, �d_om,
and goqdrwss: "For you created all things, and by your will they
existed and were created." 142 Therefore the Psalmist exclaims: "0 2 1 6, 1 951
LORD, how manifold are your works ! In wisdom you have made
them all"; and "The LORD is good to all, and his compassion is over
all that he has made." 143

78

Part One

God creates "out of nothing"

296
We believe that God needs no pre-existent thing or any
help in order to create, nor is creation any sort of necessary ema285 nation from the divine substance. 144 God creates freely "out of
nothing": 145
If God had drawn the world from pre-existent matter, what
would be so extraordinary in that? A human artisan makes
from a given material whatever he wants, while God shows
his power by starting from nothing to make all he wants. 146

Scripture bears witness to faith in creation " out of nothing"
297
as a truth full of promise and hope. Thus the mother of seven sons
338 encourages them for martyrdom:
I do not know how you came into being in my womb . It was
not I who gave you life and breath, nor I who set in order the
elements within each of you. Therefore the Creator of the
world, who shaped the beginning of man and devised the
origin of all things, will in his mercy give life and breath back
to you again, since you now forget yourselves for the sake of
his laws . . . . Look at the heaven and the earth and see
everything that is in them, and recognize that God did not
make them out of things that existed. Thus also mankind
comes into being. 147

Since God could create everything out of nothing, he can
also, through the Holy Spirit, give spiritual life to sinners by
1375 creating a pure heart in them 148 and bodily life to the dead through
the Resurrection. God " gives life to the dead and calls into existence
992 the things that do not exist." 149 And since God was able to make
light shine in darkness by his Word, he can also give the light of
faith to those who do not yet know him. 1so

298

God creates an ordered and good world
339 299
Because God creates through wisdom, his creation is ordered : "You have arranged all things by measure and nurnber and
weight." 151 The universe, created in and by the eternal Word, the

"image of the invisible God," is destined for and addressed to man,
himself created in the "image of God " and called to a personal
relationship with God.l 52 Our human understanding, which
shares in the light of the divine intellect, can understand what God 41, 1 1 4 7
tells us by means of his creation, though not without great effort
and only in a spirit of humility and respect before the Creator and
his work. 153 Because creation comes forth from God's goodness, it
shares in that goodness - "And God saw that it was good . . . very
good"l 54 - for God willed creation as a gift addressed to man, an
inheritance destined for and entrusted to him . On many occasions
the Church has had to defend the goodness of creation, including 358
that of the physical world.l 55
241 5

God transcends creation and is present to it

300
God is infinitely greater than all his works: "You have set
your glory above the heavens." 156 Indeed, God's "greatness is
unsearchable." 157 But because he is the free and sovereign Creator, 42
the first cause of all that exists, God is present to his creatures' 223
inmost being: "In him we live and move and have our being." 158
In the words of St. Augustine, God is "higher than my highest and
more inward than my inn ermost sel£. " 159
God upholds and sustains creation
With creation, God does not abandon his creatures to

and at every moment, upholds and sustains them in being, enables

Goo CARRIES OUT HIS PLAN: DIVINE PROVIDENCE

V.

Creation has its own goodness and proper perfection, but
it did not spring forth complete from the hands of the Creator. The
universe was created "in a state of journeying" (in statu viae)
toward an ultimate perfection yet to be attained, to which God has
destined it. We call " divine providence" the dispositions by which
God guides his creation toward this perfection:

302

By his providence God protects and governs all things which
he has made, "reaching mightily from one end of the earth
to the other, and ordering all things well." For "all are open
and laid bare to his eyes," even those things which are yet to
come into existence through the free action of creatures. l61

The witness of Scripture is unanimous that the solicitude
of divine providence is concrete and immediate; God cares for all,
from the least things to the great events of the world and its history.
The sacred books powerfully affirm God's absolute sovereignty
over the course of events: "Our God is in the heavens; he does
269 whatever he pleases." 1 62 And so it is with Christ, "who opens and
no one shall shut, who shuts and no one opens." 1 63 As the book of
Proverbs states: "Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is
the purpose of the Lord that will be established." 164

303

304

2568

And so we see the Holy Spirit, the principal author of Sacred
Scripture, often attributing actions to God without mentioning any secon­
dary causes. This is not a "primitive mode of speech," but a profound way
of recalling God's primacy and absolute Lordship over history and the
world, 1 65 and so of educating his people to trust in him. The prayer of the
Psalms is the great school of this trust. 166

Jesus asks for childlike abandonment to the providence of
our heavenly Father who takes care of his children's smallest
2 1 1 5 needs: "Therefore do not be anxious, saying, 'What shall we eat?'
or 'What shall we drink?' . . . . Your heavenly Father knows that
you need them all. But seek first his kingdom and his righteous­
ness, and all these things shall be yours as well." 1 67

Providence and secondary causes

306
God is the sovereign master of his plan. But to carry it out
he also makes use of his creatures' cooperation . This use is not a
sign of weakness, but rather a token of almighty God's greatness 1 884
and goodness. For God grants his creatures not only their existence,
but also the dignity of acting on their own, of being causes and
principles for each other, and thus of cooperating in the accom­ 1 951
plishment of his plan.
To human beings God even gives the power of freely
sharing in his providence by entrusting them with the responsibil­
ity of "subduing" the earth and having dominion over it. 168 God
thus enables men to be intelligent and free causes in order to
complete the work of creation, to perfect its harmony for their own
good and that of their neighbors. Though often unconscious col­
laborators with God's will, they can also enter deliberately into the
divine plan by their actions, their prayers, and their sufferings. 169
They then fully become "God's fellow workers" and co-workers
for his kingdom. 170

308
The truth that God is at work in all the actions of his
creatures is inseparable from faith in God the Creator. God is the
first cause who operates in and through secondary causes: "For
God is at work in you, both to will and to work for his good
pleasure." 171 Far from diminishing the creature's dignity, this truth
enhances it. Drawn from nothingness by God's power, wisdom,
and goodness, it can do nothing if it is cut off from its origin, for 970
"without a Creator the creature vanishes. " 172 Still less can a creature attain its ultimate end without the help of God's grace.l 73
Providence and the scandal of evil
If God the Father almighty, the Creator of the ordered and
good world, cares for all his creatures, why does evil exist? To this
question, as pressing as it is unavoidable and as painful as it is 1 64, 385
mysterious, no quick answer will suffice. Only Christian faith as a 2850
whole constitutes the answer to this question: the goodness of

creation, the drama of sin, and the patient love of God who comes
to meet man by his covenants, the redemptive Incarnation of his
Son, his gift of the Spirit, his gathering of the Church, the power of
the sacraments, and his call to a blessed life to which free creatures
are invited to consent in advance, but from which, by a terrible
mystery, they can also tum away in advance. There is not a single

aspect of the Christian message that is not in part an answer to the
question of evil.
310
But why did God not create a world so perfect that no evil
could exist in it? With infinite power God could always create
412 something betterP4 But with infinite wisdom and goodness God
1 042-1 050 freely willed to create a world "in a state of journeying " toward its
ultimate perfection. In God's plan this process of becoming in­
volves the appearance of certain beings and the disappearance of
342 others, the existence of the more perfect alongside the less perfect,
both constructive and destructive forces of nature. With physical
good there exists also physical evil as long as creation has not
reached perfectionP5
311
Angels and men, as intelligent and free creatures, have to
journey toward their ultimate destinies by their free choice and
396 preferential love. They can therefore go astray. Indeed, they have
1 849 sinned. Thus has moral evil, incommensurably more harmful than
physical evil, entered the world. God is in no way, directly or
indirectly, the cause of moral evil. 176 He permits it, however,
because he respects the freedom of his creatures and, mysteriously,
knows how to derive good from it:
For almighty God . . . , because he is supremely good, would
never allow any evil whatsoever
exist in his works if he
were not so all-powerful and good as to cause good to
emerge from evil itse1f. 177

In time we can discover that God in his almighty provi­
dence can bring a good from the consequences of an evil, even a
moral evil, caused by his creatures: "It was not you," said Joseph
to his brothers, "who sent me here, but God . . . . You meant evil
against me; but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many
598-600 people should be kept alive." 178 From the greatest moral evil ever
committed - the rej ection and murder of God's only Son, caused

by the sins of all men - God, by his grace that "abounded all the
more," 1 79 brought the greatest of goods: the glorification of Christ
and our redemption. But for all that, evil never becomes a good.
1 994
313
"We know that in everything God works for good for those
who love him." 180 The constant witness of the saints confirms this 227
truth:
St. Catherine of Siena said to "those who are scandalized and
rebel against what happens to them": "Everything comes
from love, all is ordained for the salva tion of man, God does
nothing without this goal in mind " 181
.

St. Thomas More, shortly before his martyrdom, consoled
his daughter: "Nothing can come but that that God wills.
And I make me very sure that whatsoever that be, seem it
never so bad in sight, it shall indeed be the best. " 182
Dame Julian of Norwich: "Here I was taught by the grace of
God that I should steadfastly keep me in the faith . . . and
that at the same time I should take my stand on and earnestly
believe in what our Lord shewed in this time - that 'all
manner [of] thing shall be well."' 183

We firmly believe that God is master of the world and of
314
its history. But the ways of his providence are often unknown to
us. Only at the end, when our partial knowledge ceases, when we
see God "face to face," 184 will we fully know the ways by which - 1 040
even through the dramas of evil and sin - God has guided his 2550
creation to that definitive sabbath rest 185 for which he created
heaven and earth.

IN BRIEF
315

In the creation of the world and of man, God gave the

first and universal witness to his almighty love and his
wisdom, the first proclamation of the "plan of his
loving goodness," which finds its goal in the new
creation in Christ.

Part One

316

Though the work of creation is attributed to the Father
in particular, it is equally a truth of faith that the
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit together are the one,
indivisible principle of creation.

317

God alone created the universe freely, directly, and
without any help .

318

No creature has the infinite power necessary to "cre­
ate" in the proper sense of the word, that is, to produce
and give being to that which had in no way possessed
it (to call into existence "out of nothing") (d. OS 3624).

319

God created the world to show forth and communi­
cate his glory. That his creatures should share in his
truth, goodness, and beauty - this is the glory for
which God created them.

320

God created the universe and keeps it in existence by his
Word, the Son "upholding the universe by his word of
power" (Heb 1:3) and by his Creator Spirit, the giver of life.

321

Divine providence consists of the dispositions by
which God guides all his creatures with wisdom and
love to their ultimate end.

322

Christ invites us to filial trust in the providence of our
heavenly Father (cf. Mt 6:26-34), and St. Peter the
apostle repeats: "Cast all your anxieties on him, for he
cares about you" (1 Pet 5:7; cf. Ps 55:23).

323

Divine providence works also through the actions of
creatures. To human beings God grants the ability to
cooperate freely with his plans.

324

The fact that God permits physical and even moral evil
is a mystery that God illuminates by his Son Jesus
Christ who died and rose to vanquish evil. Faith gives
us the certainty that God would not permit an evil if
he did not cause a good to come from that very evil,
by ways that we shall fully know only in eternal life.

The Profession of Faith

Paragraph 5. Heaven and Earth

325

The Apostles' Creed professes that God is "Creator of

heaven and earth." The Nicene Creed makes it exp licit that this
profession includes "all that is, seen and unseen . "

326

The Scriptural expression "heaven and earth" means all

that exists, creation in its entirety. It also indica tes the bond, deep
within creation, that both unites heaven and earth and distin-

290

guishes the one from the other: "the earth" is the world of men,

while "heaven" or "the heavens" can designate both the firmament
and God's own "place" - " our Father in heaven" and consequently

1023, 2 794

the "heaven" too which is eschatological glory. Finally, "heaven"

refers to the saints and the "place" of the spiritual creatures, the
angels, who surround God. 186

327

The profession of faith of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215)

affirms that God "from the beginning of time made at once

(simul)

out of nothing both orders of creatures, the spiritual and the

296

corporeal, that is, the angelic and the earthly, and then (deinde) the

human creature, who as it were shares in both orders, being com­
posed of spirit and body. " 187

THE ANGELS

The existence of angels - a truth of faith

328

The existence of the spiritual, non-corporeal beings that

Sacred Scrip ture usually calls "angels" is a truth of faith. The

witness of Scripture is as clear as the unanimity of Tradition.

Who are they?

329

St. Augustine says: '" Angel' is the name of their office, not

of their nature. If you seek the name of their nature, it is 'spirit'; if

you seek the name of their office, it is 'angel' : from what they are,
'spirit,' from what they do, 'angel ."' 188 With their whole beings the
angels are

servants

and messengers of God. Because they "always

behold the face of my Father who is in heaven" they are the "mighty
ones who do his word, hearkening to the voice of his word . " 189

spiritual creatures angels have

fection all visible creatures, as the splendor of their glory bears

witness . 190

Christ " wi th all his angels"
291 331

Christ is the center of the angelic world. They are his angels:

"When the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with
him . . . . " 191 They belong to him because they were created through

and fo r him: "for in him all things were created in heaven and on

earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or prin­
cipalities or authorities - all things were created through him and
for him . " 192 They belong to him still more because he has made

them messengers of his saving plan: "Are they not all ministering
spirits sent forth to serve, for the sake of those who are to obtain

salvation?" 193

332

Angels have been p resent since creation and throughout

the history of salvation, announcing this salvation from afar or near

and serving the accomplishment of the divine plan: they closed the

earthly p aradise; p rotected Lot; saved Hagar and her child; stayed

Abraham's hand; communicated the law by their ministry; led the

People of God; anno unced births and callings; and assisted the
prophets, just to cite a few examples. 194 Finally, the angel G ab riel
announced the birth of the Precursor and that of Jesus himsel£. 195

333

From the Incarnation to the Ascension, the life of the Word

incarnate is surrounded by the adoration and service of angels.

When God "brings the firstborn into the world, he says: 'Let all

559 God's angels worship him ."' 196 Their song of praise at the birth of
Christ has not ceased resounding in the Church's p raise: "Glory to
God in the highest!" 19 7 They protect Jesus in his infancy, serve him
in the desert, strengthen him

in his agony in the garden, when he

could have been saved by them from the hands of his enemies as
Israel had been .1 98 Again, it is the angels who "evangelize" by

the mysterious and powerful help of angels . 201

. ["May the angels lead you

.

1 1 38

Byzantine Liturgy, she celebrates the memory of certain angels
more particularly (St. Michael, St . G abriel, St. Raphael, and the
guardian angels) .

336

From its beginnin g until dea th, human life is surrounded

by their watchful care and intercession. 202 "Beside each believer
stands an angel as protector and shepherd leading him to life."203

Already here on earth the Christian life shares by faith in the

blessed company of angels and men united in God .

II.

THE VISIBLE WORLD

337

God himself created the visible world in all its richness,

diversity, and order. Scripture presents the work of the Creator

symbolically as a succession of six d ays of divine "work," coneluded by the "rest" of the seventh day.204 On the subject of

290

creation, the sacred text teaches the truths revealed by God for our

salvation, 205 permitting us to "recognize the irmer na ture, the

value, and the ordering of the whole of creation to the praise of
God." 206

existent beings, all of nature, and all human history are rooted in
this primordial event, the very genesis by which the world was
constituted and time begun. 207

339
Each creature possesses its own particular goodness and perfec­
tion. For each one of the works of the "six days" it is said: "And
2501 God saw that it was good. " " By the very nature of creation, material
being is endowed with its own stability, truth, and excellence, its
own order and laws." 208 Each of the various creatures, willed in its
299 own being, reflects in its own way a ray of God's infinite wisdom
and goodness. Man must therefore respect the particular goodness
266 of every creature, to avoid any disordered use of things which
would be in contempt of the Creator and would bring disastrous
consequences for human beings and their environment.
1 93 7 340
God wills the interdependence of creatures. The sun and the
moon, the cedar and the little flower, the eagle and the sparrow:
the spectacle of their countless diversities and inequalities tells us
that no creature is self-sufficient. Creatures exist only in depend­
ence on each other, to complete each other, in the service of each
other.
283 341
The beauty of the universe: The order and harmony of the
2500 created world results from the diversity of beings and from the
relationships which exist among them. Man discovers them pro­
gressively as the laws of nature. They call forth the admiration of
scholars. The beauty of creation reflects the infinite beauty of the
Creator and ought to inspire the respect and submission of man's
intellect and will.
310 342
The hierarchy of creatures is expressed by the order of the
"six days," from the less perfect to the more perfect. God loves all
his creatures209 and takes care of each one, even the sparrow.
Nevertheless, Jesus said: "You are of more value than many spar­
rows," or again: "Of how much more value is a man than a
sheep ! "210

Man is the summit of the Creator's work, as the inspired
355 343
account expresses by clearly distinguishing the creation of man
from that of the other creatures. 211

There is a solidarity among all creatures arising from the fact 293, 1 939
that all have the same Creator and are all ordered to his glory:

May you be praised, 0 Lord, in all your creatures, especially
brother sun, b y whom you give us light for the day; he is
beautiful, radiating great splendor, and offering us a symbol
of you, the Most High . . . .
May you be praised, my Lord, for sister water, who is very
useful and humble, precious and chaste . . . .
May you be praised, my Lord, for sister earth, our mother,
who bears and feeds us, and produces the variety of fruits
and dappled flowers and grasses . . . .
Praise and bless my Lord, give thanks and serve him in all
humility. 212

The sabbath - the end of the work of the six days. The sacred
text says that "on the seventh day God finished his work which he
had done," that the "heavens and the earth were finished," and that 2 1 68
God "rested" on this day and sanctified and blessed it.213 These
inspired words are rich in profitable instruction:
345

In creation God laid a foundation and established laws that
remain firm, on which the believer can rely with confidence, for they are
the sign and pledge of the unshakeable faithfulness of God's covenant. 21 4
For his part man must remain faithful to this foundation and respect the
laws which the Creator has written into it.

2 1 69

347
Creation was fashioned with a view to the sabbath and therefore
for the worship and adoration of God. Worship is inscribed in the order of
creation. 215 As the rule of St. Benedict says, nothing should take precedence over "the work of God," that is, solemn worship.216 This indicates
the right order of human concerns.

1 145-1152

The sabbath is at the heart of lsrael's law. To keep the commandments is to correspond to the wisdom and the will of God as expressed in
his work of creation.

of Christ's Resurrection. The seventh day completes the first creation. The eighth day begins the new creation. Thus, the work of 2 1 74
creation culminates in the greater work of redemption. The first 1046
creation finds its meaning and its summit in the new creation in
Christ, the splendor of which surpasses that of the first creation.2 17

IN BRIEF
350

Angels are spiritual creatures who glorify God with­
out ceasing and who serve his saving plans for other
creatures: "The angels work together for the benefit of
us all" (St. Thomas Aquinas, 5Th I, 1 14, 3, ad 3).

351

The angels surround Christ their Lord. They serve him
especially in the accomplishment of his saving mission
to men.

352

The Church venerates the angels who help her on her
earthly pilgrimage and protect every human being.

353

God willed the diversity of his creatures and their own
particular goodness, their interdependence, and their
order. He destined all material creatures for the good
of the human race. Man, and through him all creation,

Respect for laws inscribed in creation and the relations
which derive from the nature of things is a principle

Paragraph 6. Man

355
"God created man in his own image, in the image of God
he created him , male and female he created them." 21 8 Man occupies a unique place in creation: (I) he is "in the image of God"; (II) 1 700, 343
in his own nature he unites the spiritual and material worlds; (III)
he is created "male and female"; (IV) God established him in his
friendship.

356
Of all visible creatures only man is "able to know and love
his creator." 219 He is "the only creature on earth that God has
willed for its own sake," 220 and he alone is called to share, by 1 703, 2258
knowledge and love, in God's own life. It was for this end that he
was created, and this is the fundamental reason for his dignity:
225
What made you establish man in so great a dignity? Certainly the incalculable love by which you have looked on
your creature in yourself! You are taken with love for her;
for by love indeed you created her, by love you have given
22
her a being capable of tasting your eternal Good. 1

295

Being in the image of God the human individual possesses
357
the dignity of a person, who is not just something, but someone.
He is capable of self-knowledge, of self-possession and of freely 1 935
giving himself and entering into communion with other persons. 1 877
And he is called by grace to a covenant with his Creator, to offer
him a response of faith and love that no other creature can give in
his stead.
358
God created everything for man,222 but man in tum was
created to serve and love God and to offer all creation back to him: 299, 901
What is it that is about to be created, that enjoys such honor?
It is man - that great and wonderful living creature, more
precious in the eyes of God than all other creatures! For him
the heavens and the earth, the sea and all the rest of creation
exist. God attached so much importance to his salvation that
he did not spare his own Son for the sake of man. Nor does
he ever cease to work, trying every possible means, until he

St. Paul tells us that the human race takes its origin from two
men: Adam and Christ . . . . The first man, Adam, he says,
became a living soul, the last Adam a life-giving spirit. The
first Adam was made by the last Adam, from whom he also
received his soul, to give him life . . . . The second Adam
stamped his image on the first Adam when he created him.
That is why he took on himself the role and the name of the
first Adam, in order that he might not lose what he had made
in his own image. The first Adam, the last Adam: the first
had a beginning, the last knows no end. The last Adam is
indeed the first; as he himself says: "I am the first and the
last." 225

388, 41 1

Because of its common origin the human race forms a unity,
225, 404, 775 360
831, 842 for "from one ancestor [God] made all nations to inhabit the whole
earth" : 226
0 wondrous vision, which makes us contemplate the human

race in the unity of its origin in God . . . in the unity of its
nature, composed equally in all men of a material body and
a spiritual soul; in the unity of its immediate end and i ts
mission in the world; in the unity of its dwelling, the earth,
whose benefits all men, by right of nature, may use to sustain
and develop life; in the unity of its supernatural end : God
himself, to w hom all ought to tend; in the unity of the means
for attaining this end; . . . in the unity of the redemption
wrought by Christ for alJ. 227

"This law of human solidarity and charity," 228 without
1 939 excluding the rich variety of persons, cultures, and peoples, assures
us that all men are truly brethren.

nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being." 229 Man,
whole and entire, is therefore willed by God.

363
In Sacred Scripture the term "soul" often refers to human
l ife or the entire human person. 230 But "soul" also refers to the 1 703
innermost aspect of man, that which is of greatest value in him,231
that by which he is most especially in God's image: "soul" signifies
the spiritual principle in man.
364
The human body shares in the dignity of "the image of
God": it is a human body precisely because it is animated by a
spiritual soul, and it is the whole human person that is intended to 1 004
become, in the body of Christ, a temple of the Spirit: 232
Man, though made of body and soul, is a unity. Through his
very bodily condition he sums up in himself the elements of
the material world. Through him they are thus brought to
their highest perfection and can raise their voice in praise
freely given to the Creator. For this reason man may not
despise his bodily life. Rather he is obliged to regard his body
as good and to hold it in honor since God has created it and
2
will raise it up on the last day_ 33

2289

The unity of soul and body is so profound that one has to
365
consider the soul to be the "form" of the body: 234 i.e., it is because
of its spiritual soul that the body made of matter becomes a living,
human body; spirit and matter, in man, are not two natures united,
but rather their union forms a single nature.

366
The Church teaches that every spirit:ual soul is created
immediately by God - it is not "produced" by the parents - and 1 005
also that it is immortal: it does not perish when it separates from 997
the body at death, and it will be reunited with the body at the final
Resurrection. 235
367
Sometimes the soul is distinguished from the spirit: St. Paul
for instance prays that God may sanctify his people "wholly," with
"spirit and soul and body" kept sound and blameless at the Lord's 2083
coming.236 The Church teaches that this distinction does not introduce a duality into the soul.237 "Spirit" signifies that from creation

"MALE AND FEMALE HE CREATED THEM"

Equality and difference willed by God

369
Man and woman have been created, which is to sa y, willed
by God: on the one hand, in perfect equality as human persons; on
the other, in their respective beings as man and woman. "Being
man" or "being woman" is a reality which is good and willed b y
God: man and woman possess an inalienable dignity which comes
to them immediately from God their Creator. 240 Man and woman
are both with one and the same dignity "in the image of God." In
their ''being-man" and "being-woman," they reflect the Creator's
wisdom and goodness.
370
In no way is God in man's image. He is neither man nor woman.
God is pure spirit in which there is no place for the difference between the
42, 239 sexes. But the respective "perfections" of man and woman reflect some­
thing of the infinite erfection of God: those of a mother and those of a
father and husband. 41

i.j

"Each for the other"

-

"A unity in two"

371
God created man and woman together and willed each for
the other. The Word of God gives us to understand this through
1 605 various features of the sacred text. "It is not good that the man
should be alone. I will make him a helper fit for him. " 242 None of
the animals can be man's partner. 243 The woman God "fashions"
from the man's rib and brings to him elicits on the man's part a cry
of wonder, an exclamation of love and communion: "This at last is
bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh."244 Man discovers woman
as another "I," sharing the same humanity.

Man and woman were made "for each other" - not that God
left them half-made and incomplete: he created them to be a commrm­
ion of persons, in which each can be "helpmate" to the other, for they
are equal as persons ('bone of my bones . . . ") and complementary as
masculine and feminine. In marriage God rmites them in such a way
that, by forming "one flesh/'245 they can transmit human life: "Be
fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth." 246 By transmitting human 1 652, 2366
life to their descendants, man and woman as spouses and parents
cooperate in a rmique way in the Creator's work. 247
373
In God's plan man and woman have the vocation of "sub­
duing" the earth248 as stewards of God. This sovereignty is not to
be an arbitrary and destructive domination. God calls man and 307
woman, made in the image of the Creator "who loves everything 2415
that exists," 249 to share in his providence toward other creatures;
hence their responsibility for the world God has entrusted to them.
IV.

MAN IN PARADISE

374
The first man was not only created good, but was also
established in friendship with his Creator and in harmony with
himself and with the creation arormd him, in a state that would be 54
surpassed only by the glory of the new creation in Christ.
375
The Church, interpreting the symbolism of biblical lan­
guage in an authentic way, in the light of the New Testament and
Tradition, teaches that our first parents, Adam and Eve, were
constituted in an original "state of holiness and justice. " 250 This 1 997
grace of original holiness was "to share in . . . divine life."251
376
By the radiance of this grace all dimensions of man's life
were confirmed. As long as he remained in the divine intimacy,
man would not have to suffer or die. 252 The inn e r harmony of the 1 008, 1502
human person, the harmony between man and woman,253 and
finally the harmony between the first couple and all creation,
comprised the state called "original justice. "

The "mastery" over the world that God offered man from
the beginn il� as realized above all within man himself: mastery
of self The first man was unimpaired and ordered in his whole
being because he was free from the triple concupiscence254 that
subjugates him to the pleasures of the senses, covetousness for
earthly goods, and self-assertion, contrary to the dictates of reason.

2415 378
The sign of man's familiarity with God is that God places
2427 him in the garden. 255 There he lives "to till it and keep it." Work is

not yet a burden, 256 but rather the collaboration of man and woman
with God in perfecting the visible creation.

379
This entire harmony of griginal justice, foreseen for man
in God's plan, will be lo �y the sin of our first parents.

IN BRIEF
380

"Father, . . . you formed man in your own likeness and
set him over the whole world to serve you, his creator,
and to rule over all creatures" (Roman Missal, EP IV 118).

381

Man is predestined to reproduce the image of God's
Son made man, the "image of the invisible God" (Col
1 : 15 ) , so that Christ shall be the first-born of a multi­
tude of brothers and sisters (d. Eph 1 :3-6; Rom 8:29).

382

"Man, though made of body and soul, is a unity " (GS
14 § 1). The doctrine of the faith affirms that the spiri­
tual and immortal soul is created immediately by God.

383

"God did not create man a solitary being. From the
beginning, 'male and female he created them' (Gen 1:27).
This partnership of man and woman constitutes the first
form of commrmion between persons" (GS 12 § 4).

384

Revelation makes known to us the state of original
holiness and justice of man and woman before sin:
from their friendship with God flowed the happiness
of their existence in paradise.

Paragraph 7. The Fal l

385
God is infinitely good and all his works are good. Yet no
one can escape the experience of suffering or the evils in nature
which seem to be linked to the limitations proper to creatures: and
above all to the question of moral evil. Where does evil come from?
"I sought whence evil comes and there was no solution," said St.
Augustine,257 and his own painful quest would only be resolved
by his conversion to the living God. For "the mystery of lawlessness" is clarified only in the light of the "mystery of our relig­
ion." 258 The revelation of divine love in Christ manifested at the
same time the extent of evil and the superabundance of grace. 259
We must therefore approach the question of the origin of evil by
fixing the eyes of our faith on him who alone is its conqueror. 260

WHERE SIN ABOUNDED, GRACE ABOUNDED
ALL THE MORE

The reality of sin

386
Sin is present in human history; any attempt to ignore it or
to give this dark reality other names would be futile. To try to
understand what sin is, one must first recognize the profound relation of man to God, for only in this relationship is the evil of sin
unmasked in its true identity as h_umanity's rejection of Gqd and 1 847
opposition to him, even as it continues to weigh heavy on human
life and history.
387
Only the light of divine Revelation clarifies the reality of
sin and particularly of the sin committed at mankind's origins.
Without the knowledge Revelation gives of God we cannot recognize sin clearly and are tempted to explain it as merely a develop- 1 848
mental flaw, a psychological weakness, a mistake, or the necessary 1 739
consequence of an inadequate social structure, etc. Only in the
knowledge of God's plan for man can we grasp that sin is an abuse
of the freedom that God gives to created persons so that they are
capable of loving him and loving one another.

388
With the progress of Revelation, the reality of sin is also
illuminated. Although to some extent the People of God in the Old
Testament had tried to un,��rstand the pathos of the human condition in the light of the history of the fall narrated in Genesis, they
could not grasp this story's ultimate meaning, which is revealed
only in the light of the death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ. 261
We must know Christ as the source of grace in order to know Adam
as the source of sin. The Spirit-Paraclete, sent by the risen Christ,
came to "convict the world concerning sin," 262 by revealing him
who is its Redeemer.

389
The doctrine of original sin is, so to speak, the "reverse
side" of the Good News that Jesus is the Savior of all men, that all
422 need salvation, and that salvation is offered to all through Christ.
The Church, which has the mind of Christ,263 knows very well that
we cannot tamper with the revelation of original sin without
' undermining the mystery of Christ.
How to read the account of the Fall
390
The account of the fall in Genesis 3 uses figurative lan­
guage, but affirms a primeval event, a deed that took place at the
289 beginning of the history of man . 264 �lati_o n gives_ us th�certainty
of faith that the whole of human history is marked by the original
fault freely committed by our first parents. 265
II.

THE FALL OF THE ANGELS

391
Behind the disobedient choice of our first parents lurks a
seductive voice, opposed to God, which makes them fall into death
2538 out- of eri.vy. 266 Scripture and the Church's Tradition see in this
being a falien angel, called "Satan" or the " devil." 267 The Church
teaches that Satan was at first a good angel, made by God: "The
devil and the other demons were indeed created naturally good by
God, but they became evil by their own doing."268

392
Scripture speaks of a sin of these angels. 269 This "fall"
consists in the free choice of these created spirits, who radically and
irrevocably rejected God and his reign. We find a reflection of that 1 850
rebellion in the tempter's words to our first parents: "You will be
JiJ<�od." 270 The devil "has sinned from the beginning"; he is "a
liar and the father of lies. " 271
2482
393
It is the irrevocable character of their choice, and not a defect
in the infinite divine mercy, that makes the angels' sin unforgiv- 1 033- 1 037
able. "There is no repentance for the angels after their fall, just as 1 022
there is no repentance for men after death." 272
394
Scripture witnesses to the disastrous influence of the one
Jesus calls "a murderer from the beginn in g," who would even try
to divert Jesus from the mission received from his Father. 273 "The 538-540
reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the 550
devil." 274 In its consequences the gravest of these works was the 2846-2849
me� dacious seduction that led man to disobey God.
395
The power of Satan is, nonetheless, not infinite. He is only
a creature, powerful from the fact that he is pure spirit, but still a
creature. He cannot prevent the building up of God's reign. Although Satan may act in the world out of hatred for God and his
kingdom in Christ Jesus, and although his action may cause grave
injuries - of a spiritual nature and, indirectly, even of a physical
nature - to each man and to society, the action is permitted by
divine providence which with strength and gentleness guides
human and cosmic history. It is a great mystery that providence
should permit diabolical activity, but "we know that in everything
God works for good with those who love him."275

ORIGINAL SIN

Freedom put to the test

396

God created man in his image and established him in his

friendship. A spiritual creature, man can live this friendship only

1 730 in free submission to God. The prohibition against eating "of the
3 1 1 tree o f the knowledge o f good an d evil" spells this out: "for in the
day that you eat of it, you shall die . "276 The "tree of the knowledge
of good and evil" 277 symbolically evokes the insurmountable lim­

its that man, being a creature, must freely recognize and respect
with trust. Man is dependent on his Creator and subject to the laws

301 of creation and to the moral norms that govern the use of freedom.

Man's first sin
1 707, 2541 397
Man, tempted by the devil, let his trust in his Creator die
1 850, 215 in his heart and, abu�ing his freedom, di�ob ed God's command .

?s'

This is what man's first sin consisted of. 2 8 All subsequent sin
would be disobedience toward God and lack of trust in his good­
ness.

398

In that sin man preferred himself to God and by that very

act scorned him . He chose himself over and against God, against

2084 the requirements of his creaturely status and therefore against his
own good . Constituted in a state of holiness, man was destined to

2 1 1 3 be fully "divinized" by God in glory. Seduced by the devil, he
!\ wanted to "be like God," but "without God, before God, and not
in accordance with God."279

399

Scripture portrays the tragic consequences of this first

disobedience. Adam and Eve immediately lose the grace of original
holiness. 280 They become afraid of the God of whom they have
conceived a distorted image - that of a God jealous of his preroga­
tives. 28 1

1 607 400
The harmony in which they had found themselves, thanks
251 4 to original justice, is now destroyed: the control of the soul's

woman becomes subject to tensions, their relations henceforth
marked by lust and domination. 282 Harmony with creatio n is
broken: visible creation has become alien and hostile to man . 283
Because of man, creation is now subject "to its bondage to de­
cay." 284 Finally, the consequence explicitly foretold for this disobe­
dience will come true: man will "retum to the ground,"285 for out
of it he was taken. Death makes its entrance into human history. 286

401
After that first sin, the world is virtually inundated by sin.
There is Cain's murder of his brother Abel and the universal
corruption which follows in the wake of sin. Likewise, sin fre- 1 865
quently manifests itself in the history of Israel, especially as infi- 2259
delity to the God of the Covenant and as transgression of the Law
of Moses. And even after Chr�t's atonement, sin raises its head in
countless ways among Christians. 287 Scripture and the Church's
Tradition continually recall the presence and universality of sin in 1 739
man 's history:
What Revelation makes known to us is confirmed by our
own experience. For when man looks into his own heart he
finds that he is drawn toward what is wrong and sunk in
many evils which cannot come from his good creator. Often
refusing to acknowledge God as his sour.:e, man has also
upset the relationship which should link him to his last end;
and at the same time he has broken the right order that
should reign within himself as well as between himself and
other men and all creatures. 288

so death spread to all men because all men sinned . "289 The Apostle
contrasts the universality of sin and death with the universality of 430, 605

for all men, so one man's act of righteousness leads to acquittal and

Part One

Following St. Paul, the Church has always taught that the
403
overwhelming misery which oppresses men and their inclination
2606 toward evil and death cannot be understood apart from their
connection with Adam's sin and the fact that he has transmitted to
us a sin with which we are all born afflicted, a sin which is the
"death of the soul." 291 Because of this certainty of faith, the Church
1 250 baptizes for the remission of sins even tiny infants who have not
committed personal sin. 292

404
How did the sin of Adam become the sin of all his descen­
dants? The whole human race is in Adam "as one body of one
man." 293 By this "unity of the human race" al(men are implicated
in Adam's sin, as all are implicated in Christ's justice. Still, the
transmission o_!_ original s_!!:t . is a mys�ery that we cannot fully
understanO. But we do know by Revelation that Adam had re­
ceived original holiness and justice not for himself alone, but for
all human nature. By yielding to the tempter, Adam and Eve
committed a P.ersonal sin, but this sin affected the hunJa..11.11B11l re that
they would th7ni"ransmiti!:!.q fallen stg te . 294 It is a sin which will be
transmitted by propagation to all mankind, that is, by the transmis­
sion of a human nature deprived of original holiness and justice.
And that is why original sin is called "sin" only in an analogical
sense: it is a sin "contracted" and not "committed" - a state and not
an act.
405
Although it is proper to each individual, 295 original sin
does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's
descendants. It is a deprivation of original holiness and justice, but
b uman nature has not been totally corrupted: it is wounded in the
'n atural powers proper to it; subject to ignorance, suffering, and the
dominion of death; and inclined to sin - an inclination to evil that
2515 s called "cc�ncupiscence." Baptism, by impa�ting the life of Christ's
1264 grace, er��es original sin and turns a man back toward God, but
the consequences for nature, weakened and inclined to evil, persist
in man and summon him to spiritual battle.

406
The Church's teaching on the transmission of original sin was
articulated more precisely in the fifth century, especially under the impulse
of St. Augustine's reflections against Pelagianism, and in the sixteenth
century, in opposition to the Protestant Reformation. Pelagius held that
man could, by the natural power of free will and without the necessary

A hard battle . . .

�J

407
The doctrine of original sin, closely connected with that of
redemption by Christ, provides lucid discernment of man's situation and activity in the world. By our first parents' sin, the devil 2015
has acquired a certain domination over man, even though man 2852
remains free. Original sin entails " captivity under the power of him
who thenceforth had the power of death, that is, the devil." 298

Ignorance of the fact that man has a wounded nature inclined to
e v il gives rise to serious errors in the areas of education, politics, 1 888
social action,299 and morals.
408
The consequences of original sin and of all men's personal
sins put the world as a whole in the sinful condition aptly described
in St. John's expression, "the sin of the world. "300 This expression
can also refer to the negat�fluenceexerted on people by
communal situations and social structures that are the fruit of 1 865
men 's s in s . 30 1

409
This dramatic situation of "the whole world [which] is in
251 6
the power of the evil one"302 makes man's life a battle:
The whole of man's history has been the story of dour
combat with the powers of evil, stretching, so our Lord tells
us, from the very d awn of history until the last day. Finding
himself in the midst of the battlefield man has to struggle to
do what is right, and it is at great cost to himself, and aided
by God 's grace, tha t he succeeds in achieving his own inner
303
integrity.

"You DID NOT ABANDON HIM TO THE POWER

OF DEATH"

410
After his fall, man was not abandoned by God. On the
contrary, God calls him and in a mysterious way heralds the
55, 705 coming victory over evil and his restoration from his fali. 304 This
1 609, 2568 passage in Genesis is called the Protoevangelium ("first gospel"): the
first announcement of the Messiah and Redeemer, of a battle
675 between the serpent and the Woman, and of the final victory of a
descendant of hers.
411
The Christian tradition sees in this passage an an­
nouncement of the "New Adam" who, because he "became obedi359, 615 ent unto d e a th, even d e a th on a c r o s s , " makes amends
superabundantly for the disobedience of Adam.305 Furthermore
many Fathers and Doctors of the Church have seen the woman
announced in the Protoevangelium as Mary, the mother of Christ,
the "new Eve." Mary benefited first of all and uniquely from
Christ's-victory over sin: she was preserved from all stain of
491 original sin and by a special grace of God committed no sin of any
kind during her whole earthly life. 306

412

But why did God not prevent the first man from sinningl. St.

I Leo the Great responds, "Christ's inexpressible grace gave us

3 1 0, 395 blessings better than those the demon's envy had taken away. " 307

And St. Thomas Aquinas wrote, "There is nothing to prevent
human nature's being raised up to something greater, even after
sin; God permits evil in order to dra!Y forth some greater_g_o od.
272 Thus St. Paul says, 'Where sin increased, grace abounded all the
more'; and the Exultet sings, '0 happy fault, . . . which gained for
1 994 us so great a Redeemer! '"308

plan. Their choice against God is definitive. They try
to associate man in their revolt against God.

415

"Although set by God in a state of rectitude, man,
enticed by the evil one, abused his freedom at the very
start of history. He lifted himself up against God and
sought to attain his goal apart from him" (GS 13 § 1 ) .

416

By his sin Adam, a s the first man, lost the original
holiness and justice he had received from God, not
only for himself but for all human beings.

417

Adam and Eve transmitted to their descendants human nature wounded by their own first sin and hence
deprived of original holiness and justice; this deprivation is called "original sin."

418

As a result of original sin, human nature is weakened
in its powers; subject to ignorance, suffering, and the
domination of death; and inclined to sin (This inclination is called "concupiscence.").

419

"We therefore hold, with the Council of Trent, that
original sin i� tr�smitted with hUffi:an nature, 'by
propagation, not by imitation' and that it is . . . 'proper
to each"' (Paul VI, CPG § 16).

The victory that Christ won over sin has given us
greater blessings than those which sin had taken from
us: "where sin increased, grace abounded all the
more" (Rom 5:20).

The Good News: God has sent his Son

422
"But when the time had fully come, God sent forth his Son,
born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were
389 under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. " 1 This is
"the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God":2 God has visited his
people. He has fulfilled the promise he made to Abraham and his
descendants. He acted far beyond all expectation - he has sent his
2 763 own "beloved Son." 3
423
We believe and confess that Jesus of Nazareth, born a Jew
of a daughter of Israel at Bethlehem at the time of King Herod the
Great and the emperor Caesar Augustus, a carpenter by trade, who
died crucified in Jerusalem under the procurator Pontius Pilate
during the reign of the emperor Tiberius, is the eternal Son of God
made man. He "came from God, "4 "descended from heaven,''s and
"came in the flesh. " 6 For "the Word became flesh and dwelt among
us, full of grace and truth; we have beheld his glory, glory as of the
only Son from the Father . . . . And from his fullness have we all
received, grace upon grace." 7
Moved by the grace of the Holy Spirit and drawn by the
Father, we believe in Jesus and confess: "You are the Christ, the Son
683 of the living God." 8 On the rock of this faith confessed by St. Peter,

"To preach . . . the unsearchable riches of Christ" 1 0

425
The transmission of the Christian faith consists primarily
in proclaiming Jesus Christ in order to lead others to faith in him.
From the beginning, the first disciples burned with the desire to
proclaim Christ: "We cannot but speak of what we have seen and
heard." 11 And they invite people of every era to enter into the joy 850, 858
of their communion with Christ:
Tha t which was from the beginning, which we have heard,
which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked
upon and touched with our hands, concerning the word of
life - the life was made manifest, and we saw it, and testify
to it, and proclaim to you the eternal life which was with the
Father and was made manifest to us - that which we have
seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you may
have fellowship with us; and our fellowship is with the
Father and with his SonJesus Christ. And we are wri ting this
that our joy may be complete. 12

At the heart of catechesis: Christ

426
"At the heart of catechesis we find, in essence, a Person, the
Person of Jesus of Nazareth, the only Son from the Father . . . who
suffered and died for us and who now, after rising, is living with 1 698
us forever." 13 To catechize is "to reveal in the Person of Christ the
whole of God's eternal design reaching fulfillment in that Person.
It is to seek to understand the meaning of Christ's actions and
words and of the signs worked by him." 14 Catechesis aims at 51 3
putting "people . . . in communion . . . with Jesus Christ: only he
can lead us to the love of the Father in the Spirit and make us share
in the life of the Holy Trinity." 15
260
427
In catechesis "Christ, the Incarnate Word and Son of God,
. . . is taught - everything else is taught with reference to him - and
it is Christ alone who teaches - anyone else teaches to the extent that
he is Christ's spokesman, enabling Christ to teach with his lips . . . . 2145
Every catechist should be able to apply to himself the mysterious
words of Jesus: 'My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me. "' 16 876

Whoever is called "to teach Christ" must first seek "the
surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus"; he must suffer "the
loss of all things . . . " in order to " gain Christ and be found in him,"
and "to know him and the power of his resurrection, and [to] share
his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, that if possible [he]
may attain the resurrection from the dead. " 1 7
429
From this loving knowledge of Christ springs the desire to
proclaim him, to "evangelize," and to lead others to the "yes" of
851 faith in Jesus Christ. But at the same time the need to know this
faith better makes itself felt. To this end, following the order of the
Creed, Jesus' principal titles - "Christ," "Son of God," and "Lord"
(article 2) - will be presented. The Creed next confesses the chief
mysteries of his life - those of his Incarnation (article 3), Paschal
mystery (articles 4 and 5), and glorification (articles 6 and 7) .

JESUS

430
Jesus means in Hebrew: "God saves." At the annunciation,
the angel Gabriel gave him the name Jesus as his proper name,
2 1 0 which expresses both his identity and his mission.l 8 Since God
alone can forgive sins, it is God who, in Jesus his eternal Son made
402 man, "will save his people from their sins." 19 In Jesus, God reca­
pitulates all of his history of salvation on behalf of men.
431
In the history of salvation God was not content to deliver
Israel "out of the house of bondage" 20 by bringing them out of
Egypt. He also saves them from their sin. Because sin is always an
1441, 1 850 offense against God, only he can forgive it. 21 For this reason Israel,
becoming more and more aware of the universality of sin, will no
388 longer be able to seek salvation except by invoking the name of the
Redeemer God. 22

432
The name "Jesus" signifies that the very name of God is
present in the person of his Son, made man for the universal and
definitive redemption from sins. It is the divine name that alone 589, 2666
brings salvation, and henceforth all can invoke his name, for Jesus 389
united himself to all men through his Incamation,23 so that "there 1 61
is no other name under heaven given among men by which we
must be saved." 24
433
The name of the Savior God was invoked only once in the
year by the high priest in atonement for the sins of Israel, after he
had sprinkled the mercy seat in the Holy of Holies with the sacri­
ficial blood. The mercy seat was the place of God's presence. 25 615
When St. Paul speaks of Jesus whom "God put forward as an
expiation by his blood," he means that in Christ's humanity "God
was in Christ reconciling the world to himself." 26
434
Jesus' Resurrection glorifies the name of the Savior God,
for from that time on it is the name of Jesus that fully manifests the
supreme power of the "name which is above every name. "27 The 2812
evil spirits fear his name; in his name his disciples perform miracles, for the Father grants all they ask in this name. 28
2614
435
The name of Jesus is at the heart of Christian prayer. All
liturgical prayers conclude with the words "through our Lord
Jesus Christ." The Hail Mary reaches its high point in the words 2667-2668
''blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. " The Eastern prayer of the 2 676
heart, the Jesus Prayer, says: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have
mercy on me, a sinner." Many Christians, such as St. Joan of Arc,
have died with the one word "Jesus" on their lips.
II.

CHRIST

436
The word "Christ" comes from the Greek translation of the
Hebrew Messiah, which means "anointed." It became the name
proper to Jesus only because he accomplished perfectly the divine 690, 695
mission that "Christ" signifies. In effect, in Israel those consecrated
to God for a mission that he gave were anointed in his name. This
was the case for kings, for priests and, in rare instances, for prophets.29 This had to be the case all the more so for the Messiah whom

God would send to inaugurate his kingdom definitively.30 It was
necessary that the Messiah be anointed by the Spirit of the Lord at once
71 1 -71 6 as king and priest, and also as prophet. 31 Jesus fulfilled the messianic
783 hope of Israel in his threefold office of priest, prophet, and king.

437
To the shepherds, the angel announced the birth of Jesus
as the Messiah promised to Israel: "To you is born this day in the
525, 486 city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord." 32 From the begin­
ning he was "the one whom the Father consecrated and sent into
the world," conceived as "holy" in Mary's virginal womb. 33 God
called Joseph to "take Mary as your wife, for that which is con­
ceived in her is of the Holy Spirit," so that Jesus, "who is called
Christ," should be born of Joseph's spouse into the messianic
lineage of David. 34
438
Jesus' messianic consecration reveals his divine mission,
"for the name 'Christ' implies 'he who anointed,' 'he who was
72 7 anointed' and 'the very anointing with which he was anointed.'
The one who anointed is the Father, the one who was anointed is
the Son, and he was anointed with the Spirit who is the anoint­
ing." 35 His eternal messianic consecration was revealed during the
535 time of his earthly life at the moment of his baptism by John, when
"God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with
power," "that he might be revealed to Israel"36 as its Messiah. His
works and words will manifest him as "the Holy One of God." 37
439
Many Jews and even certain Gentiles who shared their
hope recognized in Jesus the fundamental attributes of the messi528-529 anic "Son of David," promised by God to Israel. 38 Jesus accepted
547 his rightful title of Messiah, though with some reserve because it
was understood b y some of his contemporaries in too human a
sense, as essentially politicai. 39

The Profession of Faith

440
Jesus accepted Peter's profession of faith, which acknow­
ledged him to be the Messiah, by announcing the imminent Passion
of the Son of Man. 40 He unveiled the authentic content of his 552
messianic kingship both in the transcendent identity of the Son of
Man "who came down from heaven, " and in his redemptive
mission as the suffering Servant: "The Son of Man came not to be
served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. " 41
Hence the true meaning of his kingship is revealed only when he 550
is raised high on the cross. 42 Only after his Resurrection will Peter 445
be able to proclaim Jesus' messianic kingship to the People of God:
"Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has
made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified. "43
III.

THE ONLY SoN oF Goo

441
In the Old Testament, "son of God" is a title given to the
angels, the Chosen People, the children of Israel, and their kings. 44
It signifies an adoptive sonship that establishes a relationship of
particular intimacy between God and his creature. When the prom­
ised Messiah-King is called "son of God," it does not necessarily
imply that he was more than human, according to the literal
meaning of these texts. Those who called Jesus "son of God," as the
Messiah of Israel, perhaps meant nothing more than this. 45
442
Such is not the case for Simon Peter when he confesses
Jesus as "the Christ, the Son of the living God," for Jesus responds
solemnly: "Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my
Father who is in heaven." 46 Similarly Paul will write, regarding his 552
conversion on the road to Damascus, "When he who had set me
apart before I was born, and had called me through his grace, was
pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach him
among the Gentiles . . . . " 47 "And in the synagogues immediately
[Paul] proclaimed Jesus, saying, 'He is the Son of God."' 48 From
the beginning this acknowledgment of Christ's divine sonship will 424

be the center of the apostolic faith, first professed by Peter as the
Church's foundation.49
443
Peter could recognize the transcendent character of the Mes­
siah's divine sonship because Jesus had clearly allowed it to be so
understood. To his accusers' question before the Sanhedrin, "Are you
the Son of God, then?" Jesus answered, "You say that I am."so Well
before this, Jesus referred to himself as "the Son" who knows the
Father, as distinct from the "servants" God had earlier sent to his
people; he is superior even to the angels.Sl He distinguished his
sonship from that ofhis disciples by never saying "our Father," except
to command them: "You, then, pray like this: 'Our Father,"' and he
2 786 emphasized this distinction, saying "my Father and your Father." 52
444
The Gospels report that at two solemn moments, the Bap­
tism and the Transfiguration of Christ, the voice of the Father
536, 554 designates Jesus his ''beloved Son."53 Jesus calls himself the "only
Son of God," and by this title affirms his etef!l�l P..I��]<j.stence.54 He
asks for faith in "the name of the only Son of God."ss In the
centurion's exclamation before the crucified Christ, "Truly this
man was the Son of God,"56 that Christian confession is already
heard. Only in the Paschal mystery can the believer give the title
"Son of God" its full meaning.
445
After his Resurrection, Jesus' divine sonship becomes

rendered as Kyrios, "Lord." From then on, "Lord" becomes the more
usual name by which to indicate the divinity oflsrael's God. The New
Testament uses this full sense of the title "Lord" both for the Father
and - what is new - for Jesus, who is thereby recognized as God
Hirnself.60
447
Jesus ascribes this title to himself in a veiled way when he
disputes with the Pharisees about the meaning of Psalm 110, but
also in an explicit way when he addresses his apostles.6 1 Throughout his public life, he demonstrated his divine sovereignty by 548
works of power over nature, illnesses, demons, death, and sin.
448
Very often in the Gospels people address Jesus as "Lord."
This title testifies to the respect and trust of those who approach
him for help and healing. 62 At the prompting of the Holy Spirit,
"Lord" expresses the recognition of the divine mystery of Jesus.63 208, 683
In the encounter with the risen Jesus, this title becomes adoration:
"My Lord and my God!" It thus takes on a connotation of love and
affection that remains proper to the Christian tradition: "It is the
641
Lord!" 64
449
By attributing to Jesus the divine title "Lord," the first
confessions of the Church's faith affirm from the beginning that the
power, honor, and glory due to God the Father are due also to Jesus,
because "he was in the form of God,"65 and the Father manifested 461
the sovereignty of Jesus by raising him from the dead and exalting 653
him into his glory. 66

From the beginning of Christian history, the assertion of
450
Christ's lordship over the world and over history has implicitly
recognized that man should not submit his personal freedom in an 668-6 72
absolute manner to any earthly power, but only to God the Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ: Caesar is not "the Lord."67 "The Church 2242
. . believes that the key, the center, and the purpose of the whole
of man's history is to be found in its Lord and Master." 68

Christian prayer is characterized by the title "Lord,"

2664-2665 whether in the invitation to prayer ("The Lord be with you. "), its
281 7 conclusion ("through Christ our Lord"), or the exclamation full of

trust and hope: Maran atha ("Our Lord, come!"), or Marana tha
("Come, Lord!") - " Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!" 69

IN BRIEF
452

The name Jesus means "God saves." The child born of
the Virgin Mary is called Jesus, "for he will save his
people from their sins" (Mt 1:21): "there is no other
name under heaven given among men by which we
must be saved" (Acts 4:12).

453

The title "Christ" means "Anointed One" (Messiah).
Jesus is the Christ, for "God anointed Jesus of Naz­
areth with the Holy Spirit and with power" (Acts
10:38). He was the one "who is to come" (Lk 7:19), the
object of "the hope of Israel" (Acts 28:20).

454

The title "Son of God" signifies the unique and eternal
relationship of Jesus Christ to God his Father: he is the
only Son of the Father (d. Jn 1 :14,18; 3: 16,18); he is God
himself (d. Jn 1 : 1). To be a Christian, one must believe
that Jesus Christ is the Son of God (d. Acts 8:37; 1 Jn
2:23).

455

The title "Lord" indicates divine sovereignty. To con­
fess or invoke Jesus as Lord is to believe in his divinity.
"No one can say 'Jesus is Lord' except by the Holy
Spirit" (1 Cor 12:3).

"HE WAS CONCEIVED BY TIIE POWER OF TIIE HOLY

SPIRIT, AND WAS BORN OF TIIE VIRGIN MARY''
Paragraph 1 . The Son of God Became Man

I.

WHY DID THE WORD BECOME fLESH?

456

With the Nicene Creed, we answer by confessing: "For us

men and for our salvation he came down from heaven; by the
power of the Holy Spirit, he became incarnate of the Virgin Mary,
and was made man."

457
The Word became flesh for us in order to save us by reconcil­
ing us with God, who "loved us and sent his Son to be the expiation

for our sins " : "the Father has sent his Son as the Savior of the

world," and "he was revealed to take away sins": 70

\

Sick, our nature demanded to be healed; fallen, to be raised
up; dead, to rise again. We ha<:l Jost the possession of the
good; it was necessary for it to be given back to us. Closed
in the darkness, it was necessary to bring us the light; cap­
tives, we awaited a Savior; prisoners, help; slaves, a liberator.
Are these things minor or insignificant? Did they not move
God to descend to human nature and visit it, since humanity
was in so miserable and unhappy a state?71

607
385

458
The Word became flesh so that thus we might know God's
love: "In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that

God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through
him." 72 "For God s o loved the world that he gave his only Son, that
whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." 73

The Word became flesh

and the life; no one comes to

mountain of the Transfiguration, the Father commands: "Listen to

him ! " 75 Jesus is the model for the Beatitudes and the norm of the
new law: "Love one another as I have loved you." 76 This love
implies an effective offering of oneself, after his example. 77

made man, might make men gods." 81

II.

THE INCARNATION

461

Taking up St. John's expression, "The Word became flesh," 82

653, 661 the Church calls "Incarnation" the fact that the Son o f God assumed
449 a human nature in order to accomplish our salvation in it. In a hymn
cited by St. Paul, the Church sings the mystery of the Incarnation:

Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ
Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count
equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied him­
self, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness
of men. And being found in human form he humbled himself
and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross. 83

462

The

Letter to the Hebrews refers to the same mystery:

Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said,
"Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body
have you prepared for me; in burnt offerings and sin offer­
ings you have taken no pleasure. Then I said, 'Lo, I have
come to do your will, 0 God."' 84

463

Belief in the true Incarnation of the Son of God is the distinc­

tive sign of Christian faith: "By this you know the Spirit of God: every

90 spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of
God . " 8S Such

is the joyous conviction of the Church from her begin­

ning whenever she sings "the mystery of our religion": "He was
manifested in the flesh."86

TRuE Goo AND TRUE MAN

464

The rmique and altogether singular event o f the Incarna­

tion of the Son of God does not mean that Jesus Christ is part God

and part man, nor does it imply that he is the result of a confused

mixture of the divine and the human. He became truly man while
remaining truly God. Jesus Christ is true God and true man. During
the first centuries, the Church had to defend and clarify this truth

88

of faith against the heresies that falsified it.

465

The first heresies denied not so much Christ's divinity as

his true humanity (Gnostic Docetism) . From apostolic times the
Christian faith has insisted on the true incarnation of God's Son
"come in the flesh. " 87 But already in the third century, the Church

in a cormcil at Antioch had to affirm against Paul of Samosata that

Jesus Christ is Son of God by nature and not by adoption. The first
ecumenical council of Nicaea in

325 confessed in its Creed that the
(ho­

Son of God is "begotten, not made, of the same substance

moousios) as the Father," and condemned Arius, who had affirmed 242
that the Son of God "came to be from things that were not" and
that he was "from another substance" than that of the Father. 88

466

The Nestorian heresy regarded Christ as a human person

joined to the divine person of God's Son. Opposing this heresy, St.
Cyril of Alexandria and the third ecumenical council at Ephesus in

431

confessed "that the Word, uniting to himself in his person the

flesh animated by a rational soul, became man." 89 Christ's humanity has no other subject than the divine person of the Son of God, who

assumed it and made it his own, from his conception. For this reason

the Connell of Ephesus proclaimed in 431 that Mary truly became the

Mother of God by the human conception of the Son of God in her

495

womb: "Mother of God, not that the nature of the Word or his divinity
received the beginning of its existence from the holy Virgin, but that,

since the holy body, animated by a rational soul, which the Word of
God united to himself according to the hypostasis, was born from her,

the Word is said to be born according to the flesh."90

467

The Monophysites affirmed that the human nature had

ceased to exist as such in Christ when the divine person of God's

Son assumed it. Faced with this heresy, the fourth ecumenical
cormcil, at Chalcedon in

451, confessed:

118

Part One
Following the holy Fa thers, we unanimously teach and confess
one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ: the same perfect
in divinity and perfect in humanity, the same truly God and
truly man, composed of rational soul and body; consubstantial
with the Father as to his divinity and consubstantial with us as
to his humanity; "like us in all things but sin." He was begotten
from the Father before all ages as to his divinity and in these
last days, for us and for our salvation, was born as to his
humanity of the virgin Mary, the Mother of Gvd. 91
We confess that one and the same Christ, Lord, and only-be­
gotten Son, is to be acknowledged in two na tures without
confusion, change, division, or separation. The distinction
between the natures was never abolished by their union, but
rather the character proper to each of the two natures was
preserved as th
came together in one person (prosopon) and
�
one hypostasis.

After the Council of Chalcedon, some made of Christ's
468
human nature a kind of personal subj ect. Against them, the fifth
ecumenical council at Constantinople in 553 confessed that "there
is but one hypostasis [or person], which is our Lord Jesus Christ, one
of the Trinity." 93 Thus everything in Christ's human nature is to be
254 attributed to his divine person as its proper subject, not only his
miracles but also his sufferings and even his death: "He who was
61 6 crucified in the flesh, our Lord Jesus Christ, is true God, Lord of
glory, and one of the Holy Trinity. , 94
469

The Church thus confesses that Jesus is inseparably true

212 God and true man. He is truly the Son of God who, without ceasing

to be God and Lord, became a man and our brother:
"What he was, he remained and what he was not, he as­
sumed," sings the Roman Liturgy. 95 And the liturgy of St.
John Chrysostom proclaims and sings: "0 only-begotten Son
and Word of God, immortal being, you who deigned for our
salvation to become incarnate of the holy Mother of God and
ever-virgin Mary, you who without change became man and
were crucified, 0 Christ our God, you who by your death
have crushed death, you who are one of the Holy Trinity,
glorified with the Father and the Holy Spirit, save us!"96

IV.

How Is THE SoN OF Goo MAN?

470

Because "human nature w a s assumed, not absorbed," 97 in

the mysterious union of the Incarnation, the Church was led over

the course of centuries to confess the full reality of Christ's human

soul, with its operations of intellect and will, and of his human
body. In parallel fashion, she had to recall on each occasion that
Christ's human nature belongs, as his own, to the divine person of
the Son of God, who assumed it. Everything that Christ is and does

in this nature derives from "one of the Trinity. " The Son of God

51 6

of existence in the Trinity. In his soul as in his body, Christ thus

626

therefore communicates to his humanity his own personal mode

expresses humanly the divine ways of the Trinity: 98

The Son of God . . . worked with human hands; he thought
with a human mind. He acted with a human will, and with
a human heart he loved. Born of the Virgin Mary, he has truly
been made one of us, like to us in all things except sin.99

2599

Christ's soul and his human knowledge

471

Apollinarius of Laodicaea asserted thaL in Christ the divine

Word had replaced the soul or spirit. Against this error the Church
confessed that the eternal Son also assumed a rational, human soul. 1 00

472

This human soul that the Son of God assumed is endowed

with a true human knowledge. As such, this knowledge could not
in itself be unlimited: it was exercised in the historical conditions
of his existence in space and time . This is why the Son of God could,

when he became man, "increase in wisdom and in stature, and in
favor with God and man, " 101 and would even have to inquire for
himself about what one in the human condition can learn only from
experience. 102 This corresponded to the reality of his voluntary
emptying of himself, taking "the form of a slave. " 103

473

But at the same time, this truly human knowledge of God's

Son expressed the divine life of his person. 104 "The human nature

1 20

Part One

of God's Son,

not by itself but by its union with the Word,

knew and

showed forth in itself everything that pertains to God." 105 Such is

240 first of all the case with the intimate and immediate knowledge that
the Son of God made man has of his Father. 106 The Son in his

human knowledge also showed the divine penetration he had into
the secret thoughts of human hearts . 10 7

474

By its union to the divine wisdom in the person of the

Word incarnate, Christ enj oyed in his human knowledge the full­
ness of understanding of the eternal plans he had come to reveai. 108
What he admitted to not knowing in this area, he elsewhere de­

clared himself not sent to reveal. 109

Christ's human will

475

Similarly, at the sixth ecumenical council, Constantinople

III in 681, the Church confessed that Christ possesses two wills and

two natural operations, divine and human. They are not opposed

2008 to each other, but cooperate in such a way that the Word made flesh
2824 willed humanly in obedience to his Father all that he had decided
divinely with the Father and the Holy Spirit for our salvation. 110

Christ's human will "does not resist or oppose but rather submits
to his divine and almighty will. " l l l

Christ's true body
Since the Word became flesh in assuming a true humanity,
Christ's body was finite.l 12 Therefore the human face of Jesus can be

1 1 59-1 1 62
2 1 29-21 32 portrayed; at the seventh

ecumenical council (Nicaea

II in 787)

the

Church recognized its representation in holy images to be legitimate. 113

477

At the same time the Church has always acknowledged

that in the body of Jesus "we see our God made visible and so are
caught up in love of the God we cannot see." 114 The individual
characteristics of Christ's body express the divine person of God's

that they can be venerated when portrayed

in a holy

image, for the

believer "who venerates the icon is venerating in it the person of the one
depicted.'' 115

The heart of the Incarnate Word

478

Jesus knew and loved us each and all during his life, his

agony, and his Passion and gave himself up for each one of us: "The
Son of God . . . loved me and gave himself for me." 1 1 6 H e h a s loved

considered the chief sign and symbol of that . . . love with which 766

us all with a human heart. For this reason, the Sacred Heart of Jesus,
pierced by our sins and for our salvation, 11 7 "is quite rightly
the divine Redeemer continually loves the eternal Father and all

human beings" without exception. 11 8

IN BRIEF
4 79

At the time appointed by God, the only Son of the Father,

the eternal Word, that is, the W ord and substantial Image
of the Father, became incarnate; without losing his divine

nature he has assumed human nature.

480

Jesus Christ is true God and true man, in the unity of
his divine person; for this reason he is the one and only
mediator between God and men.

481

Jesus Christ possesses two natures, one divine and the
other human, not confused, but rmited
person of God's Son.

in

Christ, being true God and true man, has a human
intellect and will, perfectly attrmed and subject to his
divine intellect and divine will, which he has in com­
mon with the Father and the Holy Spirit.

The Incarnation is therefore the mystery of the won­
derful rmion of the divine and human natures in the
one person of the Word.

her question, "How can this be, since I know not man?" was given
72 1 by the power of the Spirit: "The Holy Spirit will come upon
you. " 121

The mission of the Holy Spirit is always conjoined and

ordered to that of the Son. 122 The Holy Spirit, "the Lord, the giver

divinely fecundate it, causing her to conceive the eternal Son of the
Father

486

in a humanity drawn from her own.
The Father's only Son, conceived as man in the womb of

the Virgin Mary, is "Christ," that is to say, anointed by the Holy

43 7 Spirit, from the beginning of his human existence, though the
manifestation of this fact takes place only progressively: to the
shepherds, to the magi, to John the Baptist, to the disciples. 123 Thus

from him. After a long period of waiting the times are fulfilled

in

established." 131

The Immaculate Conception
To become the mother of the Savior, Mary "was enriched

490

by God with gifts appropriate to such a role . " 1 32 The angel Gabriel
at the moment of the annunciation salutes her as "full of grace. " 1 33

In fact, in order for Mary to be able to give the free assent of her 2676, 2853
faith to the announcement of her vocation, it was necessary that
she be wholly borne by God's grace.

Through the centuries the Church has become ever more

491

from the moment of her conception. That is what the dogma of the

Immaculate Conception confesses, as Pope Pius IX proclaimed in

1 854:

The most Blessed Virgin Mary was, from the first moment
of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege of al­
mighty God and by virtue of the merits ofJesus Christ, Savior
of the human race, preserved immune from all stain of
original sin. 1 35

492

The "splendor of an entirely unique holiness" by which

Mary is "enriched from the first instant of her conception" comes
wholly from Christ: she is "redeemed, in a more exalted fashion,

201 1
1 077

by reason of the merits of her Son." 136 The Father blessed Mary
more than any other created person "in Christ with every spiritual
blessing in the heavenly places" and chose her "in Christ before the
foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless before him in
love."1 37

493

The Fathers of the Eastern tradition call the Mother of God

"the All-Holy"

(Panagia)

and celebrate her as "free from any stain

of sin, as though fashioned by the Holy Spirit and formed as a new
creature . " 1 38 By the grace of God Mary remained free of every
personal sin her whole life long.

"Let it be done to me according to your word . . . "

494

At the announcement that she would give birth to "the Son

of the Most High" without knowing man, by the power of the Holy

261 7
148

Spirit, Mary responded with the obedience of faith, certain that
"with God nothing will be impossible" : "Behold,

am the hand­
maid of the Lord; let it be [done] to me according to your word. " 139

I

Thus, giving her consent to God's word, Mary becomes the mother

of Jesus. Espousing the divine will for salvation wholeheartedly,

without a single sin to restrain her, she gave herself entirely to the

968

person and to the work of her Son; she did so in order to serve the
mystery of redemption with him and dependent on him, by God's
grace: 140

The Profession of Faith

125

As St. Irenaeus says, " Being obedient she became the cause
of salvation for herself and for the whole human race." 1 4 1
Hence not a few of the early Fathers gladly assert . . . : "The
knot of Eve's disobedience was untied by Mary's obedience:
wha t the virgin Eve bound through her disbelief, Mary
loosened by her faith.'' 142 Comparing her with Eve, they call
Mary " the Mother of the living" and frequently claim:
" Death through Eve, life through Mary." 143

726

Mary's divine motherhood

495

Called in the Gospels "the mother of Jesus," Mary is ac­

claimed by Elizabeth, at the prompting of the Spirit and even before
the birth of her son, as "the mother of my Lord . " 144 In fact, the One

whom she conceived as man by the Holy Spirit, who truly became

her Son according to the flesh, was none other than the Father's

eternal Son, the second person of the Holy Trinity. Hence the
Church confesses that Mary is truly "Mother of God"

tokos). 145

(Theo- 466, 2677

Mary's virginity

496

From the first formulations of her faith, the Church has

confessed that Jesus was conceived solely by the power of the Holy
Spirit in the womb of the Virgin Mary, affirming also the corporeal
aspect of this event: Jesus was conceived "by the Holy Spirit

without human seed. " 146 The Fathers see in the virginal conception

the sign that it truly was the Son of God who came in a humanity
like our own. Thus St. Ignatius of Antioch at the beginn ing of the

second century says:

You are firmly convinced about our Lord, who is truly of the
race of David according to the flesh, Son of God according
to the will and power of God, truly born of a virgin, . . . he
was truly nailed to a tree for us in his flesh under Pontius
l
Pilate . . . he truly suffered, as he is also truly risen. 47

Part One

497

The gospel accounts understand the virginal conception of

Jesus as a divine work that surpasses all human understanding and
possibility : 148 "That which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit,"
said the angel to Joseph about Mary his fiancee.1 49 The Church sees

here the fulfillment of the divine promise given through the
prophet Isaiah: "Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son. "1 5°

498
People are sometimes troubled by the silence of St. Mark's Gospel
and the New Testament Epistles about Jesus' virginal conception. Some
might wonder if we were merely dealing with legends or theological
constructs not claiming to be history. To this we must respond: Faith in the
virginal conception of J esus met with the lively opposition, mockery, or
incomprehension of non-believers, Jews and pagans alike;151 so it could
hardly have been motivated by pagan mythology or by some adaptation
to the ideas of the age. The meaning of this event is accessible only to faith,
90 which understands in it the "connection of these mysteries with one
another" 152 in the totality of Christ's mysteries, from his Incarnation to his
Passover. St. Ignatius of Antioch already bears witness to this connection:
" Mary's virginity and giving birth, and even the Lord's death escaped the
2 71 7 notice of the prince of this world: these three mysteries worthy of procla­
mation were accomplished in God's silence." 153
Mary - "ever-virgin"

499

The deepening of faith in the virginal motherhood led the

Church to confess Mary's real and perpetual virginity even in the
act of giving birth to the Son of God made rnan. 154

In fact, Christ's

birth "did not diminish his mother's virginal integrity but sancti­
fied it. " 1 55 And so the liturgy of the Church celebrates Mary as

Aeiparthenos, the "Ever-virgin . " 156

Against this doctrine the objection is sometimes raised that the
Bible mentions brothers and sisters of Jesus. 157 The Church has always
understood these passages as not referring to other children of the Virgin
Mary. In fact James and Joseph, "brothers ofJesus," are the sons of another
Mary, a disciple of Christ, whom St. Matthew significantly calls "the other
Mary." 158 They are close relations of Jesus, according to an Old Testament
expression. 159

Jesus is Mary's only son, but her spiritual motherhood

501

extends to all men whom indeed he came to save: "The Son whom

she brought forth is he whom God placed as the first-born among
many brethren, that is, the faithful in whose generation and formulation she cooperates with a mother's love . " 1 60

The eyes of faith can discover in the context of the whole

969
970

plan

of Revelation the mysterious reasons why God in his saving plan
wanted his Son to be born of a virgin. These reasons touch both on

90

the person of Christ and his redemptive mission, and on the
welcome Mary gave that mission on behalf of all men.

503
Mary's virginity manifests God's absolute initiative in the Incar­
nation. Jesus has only God as Father. "He was never estranged from the
Father because of the human nature which he assumed . . . . He is naturally
Son of the Father as to his divinity and naturally son of his mother as to
his humanity, but properly Son of the Father in both natures." 161

422

504
Jesus is conceived by the Holy Spirit in the Virgin Mary's womb
because he is the New Adam, who inaugurates the new creation: "The first
man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven." 162
From his conception, Christ's humanity is filled with the Holy Spirit, for
God "gives him the Spirit without measure." 163 From "his fullness" as the
head of redeemed humanity "we have all received, grace upon grace." 164

359

By his virginal conception, Jesus, the New Adam, ushers in the
in the Holy Spirit through faith. "How can
this be?" 165 Participation in the divine life arises "not of blood nor of the
will of the flesh nor of the will of man, b u t of God." 166 The acceptance of
this life is virginal because it is entirely the Spirit's gift to man. The spousal
character of the human vocation in relation to God1 67 is fulfilled perfectly
in Mary's virginal motherhood.

505

Mary is a virgin because her virginity is the sign of her faith
"unadulterated by any doubt," and of her undivided gift ofherself to God's

At once virgin and mother, Mary is the symbol and the most
perfect realization of the Church: " the Church indeed . . . by receiving the
word of God in faith becomes herself a mother. By preaching and Baptism
she brings forth sons, who are conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of
God, to a new and immortal life. She herself is a virgin, who keeps in its
entirety and purity the faith she pledged to her spouse. " 1 70

IN BRIEF
508

From among the descendants of Eve, God chose the
Virgin Mary to be the mother of his Son. "Full of
grace/' Mary is "the most excellent fruit of redemp­
tion"

(SC 1 03) : from the first instant of her conception,

she was totally preserved from the stain of original sin
and she remained pure from all personal sin through­
out her life.

509

Mary is truly "Mother of God" since she is the mother
of the eternal Son of God made man, who is God

himself.

510

Mary "remained a virgin in conceiving her Son, a
virgin in giving birth to him, a virgin

in carrying him,

a virgin in nursing him at her breast, always a virgin"

(St. Augustine, Serm. 186, 1 : PL 38, 999): with her whole

being she is "the handmaid of the Lord" (Lk 1 :38).

511

The Virgin Mary "cooperated through free faith and
obedience in human salvation" (LG 56) . She uttered
her yes

"in the name of all human nature" (St. Thomas
STh III, 30, 1). By her obedience she became

Aquinas,

the new Eve, mother of the living.

Paragraph 3 . The Mysteries of Christ ' s Life

512
Concerning Christ's life the Creed speaks only about the
mysteries of the Incarnation (conception and birth) and Paschal
mystery (passion, crucifixion, death, burial, descent into hell, res­
urrection, and ascension) . It says nothing explicitly about the mysteries of Jesus' hidden or public life, but the articles of faith
concerning his Incarnation and Passover do shed light on the whole 1 1 63
of his earthly life. "AU that Jesus did and taught, from the beginning until the day when he was taken up to heaven," 171 is to be
seen in the light of the mysteries of Christmas and Easter.
513
According to circumstances catechesis will make use of all
the richness of the mysteries of Jesus. Here it is enough merely to
indicate some elements common to all the mysteries of Christ's life 426, 561
(I), in order then to sketch the principal mysteries of Jesus' hidden
(II) and public (III) life.
I.

CHRIST'S WHOLE LIFE Is MYSTERY

514
Many things about Jesus of interest to human curiosity do
not figure in the Gospels. Almost nothing is said about his hidden
life at Nazareth, and even a great part of his public life is not
recounted. 172 What is written in the Gospels was set down there
"so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God,
and that believing you may have life in his name." 173
515
The Gospels were written by men who were among the
first to have the faith 174 and wanted to share it with others. Having
known in faith who Jesus is, they could see and make others see 1 2 6
the traces of his mystery in all his earthly life. From the swaddling
clothes of his birth to the vinegar of his Passion and the shroud of
his Resurrection, everything in Jesus' life was a sign of his mys­
tery. 175 His deeds, miracles, and words all revealed that "in him
the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily." 176 His humanity appeared as "sacrament," that is, the sign and instrument, of his 609, 774
divinity and of the salvation he brings: what was visible in his 477
earthly life leads to the invisible mystery of his divine sonship and
redemptive mission.

Part One

Characteristics common to Jesus' mysteries

516

Christ's whole earthly l i fe - his words and deeds, his

silences and sufferings, indeed his manner of being and speaking

65 - is Revelation of the Father. Jesus can say: "Whoever has seen me

has seen the Father," and the Fa ther can say: "This is my Son, my
Chosen; listen to him ! " 1 77 Because our Lord became man in order
to do his Father's will, even the least characteris tics of his mys teries

2 708 manifest "God's love . . . among us . " 178
517

Chris t's whole life is a mystery of redemp tion . Redemp tion

606 comes to us above all through the blood of his cross, 1 79 but this
1 1 1 5 mystery is at work throughou t Chris t's entire life:

- already in his Incarnation through which by becoming poor he
enriches us with his poverty;1SO

- in his hid den life which by his submission atones for our disobe­
d ience;1 8 1
- in his word which purifies its hearers;1 82
- in his healings and exorcisms by which "he took our infirmities

and bore our diseases";l 83

- and in his Resurrection by which he justifies us . 1 84

518

Christ's whole life is a mystery of recapitulation . All Jesus

did, said, and suffered had for its aim restoring fallen man to his
original vocation:

When Christ became incarnate and was made man, he reca­
pitulated in himself the long history of mankind and pro­
cured for us a 'short cut' to salvation, so that what we had
lost in Adam, that is, being in the im e and likeness of God,
we might recover in Christ Jesus. 18 For this reason Christ
experienced all the sta es of life, thereby giving communion
with God to all men. 1 °

Our communion in the mysteries of Jesus
519
All Christ's riches "are for every individual and are every­
body's property." 187 Christ did not live his life for himself but for
us, from his Incarnation "for us men and for our salvation" to his 793
death "for our sins" and Resurrection "for our justification." 188 He 602
is still "our advocate with the Father," who "always lives to make
intercession" for us. 189 He remains ever "in the presence of God on
our behalf, bringing before him all that he lived and suffered for 1 085
us. " 190
520
In all of his life Jesus presents himself as our model. He is
"the perfect man," 191 who invites us to become his disciples and
follow him. In humbling himself, he has given us an example to 459, 359
imitate, through his prayer he draws us to pray, and by his poverty 2607
he calls us to accept freely the privation and persecutions that may
come our way. 192
521
Christ enables us to live in him all that he himself lived, and 2715
he lives it in us. "By his Incarnation, he, the Son of God, has in a
certain way united himself with each man." 193 We are called only 1 391
to become one with him, for he enables us as the members of his
Body to share in what he lived for us in his flesh as our model:
We must continue to accomplish in ourselves the stages of
Jesus' life and his mysteries and often to beg him to perfect
and realize them in us and in his whole Church . . . . For it is
the plan of the Son of God to make us and the whole Church
partake in his mysteries and to extend them to and continue
them in us and in his whole Church. This is his plan for
fulfilling his mysteries in us. 194

expectation of this coming.

forerunn er, sent to prepare his way. 196 "Prophet of the Most High/'
71 7-720 John surpasses all the prophets, of whom he is the last_I 97 He
inaugurates the Gospet already from his mother's womb wel­
comes the coming of Christ, and rejoices in being "the friend of the
bridegroom," whom he points out as "the Lamb of God, who takes
away the sin of the world." 198 Going before Jesus "in the spirit and
power of Elijah," John bears witness to Christ in his preaching, by
his Baptism of conversion, and through his martyrdom. 199
524
When the Church celebrates the liturgy ofAdvent each year,
she makes present this ancient expectancy of the Messiah, for by
1 1 71 sharing in the long preparation for the Savior's first coming, the
faithful renew their ardent desire for his second coming. 2°0 By
celebrating the precursor's birth and martyrdom, the Church
unites herself to his desire: "He must increase, but I must de­
crease. "201

Jesus was born in a humble stable, into a poor family.202
Simple shepherds were the first witnesses to this event. In this
437 poverty heaven's glory was made manifest. 203 The Church never
2443 tires of singing the glory of this night:
The Virgin today brings into the world the Eternal

To become a child in relation to God is the condition for
entering the kingdom. 205 For this, we must humble ourselves and
become little. Even more: to become "children of God" we must be
"born from above" or "born of God." 206 Only when Christ is
formed in us will the mystery of Christmas be fulfilled in us. 207
Christmas is the mystery of this "marvelous exchange":
0 marvelous exchange! Man's Creator has become man,
born of the Virgin. We have been made sharers in the divinity of Christ who humbled himself to share our humanity. 208

The mysteries of Jesus' infancy

527
Jesus' circumcision, on the eighth day after his birth,209 is
the sign of his incorporation into Abraham's descendants, into the
people of the covenant. It is the sign of his submission to the Law 210
and his deputation to Israel's worship, in which he will participate 580
throughout his life. This sign prefigures that "circumcision of 1 2 1 4
Christ" which is Baptism. 211
528
The Epiphany is the manifestation of Jesus as Messiah of
Israel, Son of God and Savior of the world. The great feast of
Epiphany celebrates the adoration of Jesus by the wise men (magi) 439
from the East, together with his baptism in the Jordan and the
wedding feast at Cana in Galilee. 212 In the magi, representatives of
the neighboring pagan religions, the Gospel sees the first-fruits of
the nations, who welcome the good news of salvation through the
Incarnation. The magi's coming to Jerusalem in order to pay homage to the king of the Jews shows that they seek in Israel, in the
messianic light of the star of David, the one who will be king of the
nations. 213 Their coming means that pagans can discover Jesus and
worship him as Son of God and Savior of the world only by turning
toward the Jews and receiving from them the messianic promise
as contained in the Old Testament. 214 The Epiphany shows that 71 1 -71 6

The presentation of Jesus in the temple shows him to be the
firstborn Son who belongs to the Lord. 216 With Simeon and Anna,
all Israel awaits its encounter with the Savior - the name given to
this event in the Byzantine tradition. Jesus is recognized as the
long-expected Messiah, the "light to the nations" and the "glory of
Israel," but also "a sign that is spoken against." The sword of

oblation on the cross that will impart the salvation God had "pre­

The flight into Egypt and the massacre of the innocents217
make manifest the opposition of darkness to the light: "He came to
his own home, and his own people received him not."218 Christ's
whole life was lived under the sign of persecution. His own share
it with him. 219 Jesus' departure from Egypt recalls the exodus and
presents him as the definitive liberator of God's people. 220
The mysteries of Jesus' hidden life

During the greater part of his life Jesus shared the condi­
531
tion of the vast majority of human beings: a daily life spent without
evident greatness, a life of manual labor. His religious life was that
242 7 of a Jew obedient to the law of God, 221 a life in the community.
From this whole period it is revealed to us that Jesus was "obedi­
ent" to his parents and that he "increased in wisdom and in stature,
and in favor with God and man." 222
532
Jesus' obedience to his mother and legal father fulfills the
fourth commandment perfectly and was the temporal image of his
221 4-2220 filial obedience to his Father in heaven. The everyday obedience of
Jesus to Joseph and Mary both announced and anticipated the
obedience of Holy Thursday: "Not my will . . . . " 223 The obedience

THE MYSTERIES OF JESUS' PUBLIC LIFE

The baptism of Jesus

535
Jesus' public life begins with his baptism by John in the
Jordan. 228 John preaches "a baptism of repentance for the forgive71 9-720 ness of sins." 229 A crowd of sinners230 - tax collectors and soldiers,
Pharisees and Sadducees, and prostitutes - come to be baptized by
him. "Then Jesus appears." The Baptist hesitates, but Jesus insists
and receives baptism. Then the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove,
701 comes upon Jesus and a voice from heaven proclaims, "This is my
438 beloved Son."231 This is the manifestation ("Epiphany") of Jesus as
Messiah of Israel and Son of God.

536
The baptism of Jesus is on his part the acceptance and
inauguration of his mission as God's suffering Servant. He allows
himself to be numbered among sinners; he is already "the Lamb of
God, who takes away the sin of the world." 232 Already he is
anticipating the "baptism" of his bloody death. 233 Already he is
coming to "fulfill all righteousness," that is, he is submitting him­
self entirely to his Father's will: out of love he consents to this
baptism of death for the remission of our sins. 234 The Father's voice
responds to the Son's acceptance, proclaiming his entire delight in
his Son. 235 The Spirit whom Jesus possessed in fullness from his
conception comes to "rest on him." 236 Jesus will be the source of
the Spirit for all mankind. At his baptism "the heavens were
opened" 237 - the heavens that Adam's sin had closed - and the
waters were sanctified by the descent of Jesus and the Spirit, a
prelude to the new creation.
537

Through Baptism the Christian is sacramentally assimi-

1 262 lated to Jesus, who in his own baptism anticipates his death and

resurrection. The Christian must enter into this mystery of humble
self-abasement and repentance, go down into the water with Jesus
in order to rise with him, be reborn of water and the Spirit so as to

the bath of water, the Holy Spirit swoops down upon us from
high heaven and tha t adopted by the Father's voice, we
become sons of God.2'!0

Jesus' temptations

538
The Gospels speak of a time of solitude for Jesus in the
desert immediately after his baptism by John. Driven by the Spirit
into the desert, Jesus remains there for forty days without eating;
he lives among wild beasts, and angels minister to him. 241 At the
end of this time Satan tempts him three times, seeking to compro­
mise his filial attitude toward God . Jesus rebuffs these attacks, 394
which recapitulate the temptations of Adam in Paradise and of 51 8
Israel in the desert, and the devil leaves him "until an opportune
time." 242

The evangelists indicate the salvific meaning of this mys- 397
539
terious event: Jesus is the new Adam who remained faithful just
where the first Adam had given in to temptation. Jesus fulfills
Israel's vocation perfectly: in contrast to those who had once
provoked God during forty years in the desert, Christ reveals
himself as God's Servant, totally obedient to the divine will. In this, 385
Jesus is the devil's conqueror: he "binds the strong man" to take
back his plunder. 243 Jesus' victory over the tempter in the desert
anticipates victory at the Passion, the supreme act of obedience of 609
his filial love for the Father.

Jesus' temptation reveals the way in which the Son of God

2 1 1 9 is Messiah, contrary to the way Satan proposes to him and the way
51 9-2849 men wish to attribute to him. 244 This is why Christ vanquished the

Tempter for us: "For we have not a high priest who is unable to
sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has
been tested as we are, yet without sinning." 245 By the solemn forty
days of Lent the Church unites herself each year to the mystery of
1 438 Jesus in the desert.

"Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee,
preaching the gospel of God, and saying: 'The time is fulfilled, and
the kingdom of God is at hand: repent, and believe in the gospel."' 246 "To carry out the will of the Father Christ inaugurated the
kingdom of heaven on earth." 247 Now the Father's will is "to raise
up men to share in his own divine life."248 He does this by gathering men around his Son Jesus Christ. This gathering is the Church,
"on earth the seed and beginning of that kingdom." 249

542
Christ stands at the heart of this gathering of men into the
"family of God." By his word, through signs that manifest the reign
2233 of God, and by sending out his disciples, Jesus calls all people to
come together around him. But above all in the great Paschal
mystery - his death on the cross and his Resurrection - he would
accomplish the coming of his kingdom. "And I, when I am lifted
up from the earth, will draw all men to myself." Into this union
789 with Christ all men are called. 250

The proclamation of the Kingdom of God

Everyone is called to enter the kingdom. First announced
543
to the children of Israel, this messianic kingdom is intended to
accept men of all nations. 25 1 To enter it, one must first accept Jesus'
764
word:
The word of the Lord is compared to a seed which is sown
in a field; those who hear it with faith and are numbered
among the little flock of Christ have truly received the king­
dom. Then, by its own power, the seed sprouts and grows
until the harvest. 252

The kingdom belongs to the poor and lowly, which means
544
those who have accepted it with humble hearts. Jesus is sent to
"preach good news to the poor";253 he declares them blessed, for 709
"theirs is the kingdom of heaven."254 To them - the "little ones" - 2443
the Father is pleased to reveal what remains hidden from the wise 2546
and the learned. 255 Jesus shares the life of the poor, from the cradle
to the cross; he experiences hunger, thirst, and privation. 256 Jesus
identifies himself with the poor of every kind and makes active
love toward them the condition for entering his kingdom. 257
545
Jesus invites sinners to the table of the kingdom: "I came
not to call the righteous, but sinners."258 He invites them to that
conversion without which one cannot enter the kingdom, but 1 443
shows them in word and deed his Father's boundless mercy for 588, 1 846
them and the vast "joy in heaven over one sinner who repents. " 259 1 439
The supreme proof of his love will be the sacrifice of his own life
"for the forgiveness of sins." 260
546
Jesus' invitation to enter his kingdom comes in the form of
parables, a characteristic feature of his teaching. 261 Through his 2613
parables he invites people to the feast of the kingdom, but he also
asks for a radical choice: to gain the kingdom, one must give 542
everything. 262 Words are not enough; deeds are required. 263 The

parables are like mirrors for man: will he be hard soil or good earth
for the word ?264 What use has he made of the talents he has
received?265 Jesus and the presence of the kingdom in this world
are secretly at the heart of the parables. One must enter the king­
dom, that is, become a disciple of Christ, in order to "know the
secrets of the kingdom of heaven." 266 For those who stay " outside,"
everything remains enigmatic. 267
The signs of the Kingdom of God

547

Jesus accompanies his words with many "mighty works

670, 439 and wonders and signs," which manifest that the kingdom is

present in him and attest that he was the promised Messiah.268

548
The signs worked by Jesus attest that the Father has sent
him. They invite belief in him. 269 To those who tum to him in faith,
1 56, 261 6 he grants what they ask. 270 So miracles strengthen faith in the One
who does his Father's works; they bear witness that he is the Son
of God. 271 But his miracles can also be occasions for "offense";272
574 they are not intended to satisfy people's curiosity or desire for
447 magic. Despite his evident miracles some people reject Jesus; he is
even accused of acting by the power of demons. 273
549
By freeing some individuals from the earthly evils of hun­
ger, injustice, illness, and death,274 Jesus performed messianic
1 503 signs. Nevertheless he did not come to abolish all evils here be440 low,275 but to free men from the gravest slavery, sin, which thwarts
them in their vocation as God's sons and causes all forms of human
bondage . 276

550
The coming of God's kingdom means the defeat of Satan's:
"If it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom
of God has come upon you." 277 Jesus' exorcisms free some individu- 394
als from the domination of demons. They anticipate Jesus' great 1 673
victory over "the ruler of this world."278 The kingdom of God will 440, 2816
be definitively established through Christ's cross: "God reigned
from the wood." 279
"The keys of the kingdom"

551
From the beginning of his public life Jesus chose certain
men, twelve in number, to be with him and to participate in his
mission. 280 He gives the Twelve a share in his authority and "sent 858
them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal." 281 They 765
remain associated for ever with Christ's kingdom, for through
them he directs the Church:
As my Father appointed a kingdom for me, so do I appoint
for you that you may eat and drink at my table in my
kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of
Israe!. 282

552
Simon Peter holds the first place in the college of the
283
Twelve;
Jesus entrusted a unique mission to him. Through a
revelation from the Father, Peter had confessed: "You are the 880
Christ, the Son of the living God." Our Lord then declared to him: 1 53, 442
"You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church, and the
gates of Hades will not prevail against it. "284 Christ, the "living
stone," 285 thus assures his Church, built on Peter, of victory over
the powers of death. Because of the faith he confessed Peter will
remain the unshakeable rock of the Church. His mission will be to
keep this faith from every lapse and to strengthen his brothers in 424
it. 286

553
Jesus entrusted a specific authority to Peter: "I will give
you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on
881 earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth
shall be loosed in heaven." 287 The "power of the keys" designates
authority to govern the house of God, which is the Church. Jesus,
the Good Shepherd, confirmed this mandate after his Resurrection:
1 445 "Feed my sheep." 288 The power to "bind and loose" connotes the
authority to absolve sins, to pronounce doctrinal judgments, and
to make disciplinary decisions in the Church. Jesus entrusted this
authority to the Church through the ministry of the apostles289 and
641 , 881 in particular through the ministry of Peter, the only one to whom
he specifically entrusted the keys of the kingdom.
A foretaste of the Kingdom: the Transfiguration

554
From the day Peter confessed that Jesus is the Christ, the
Son of the living God, the Master "began to show his disciples that
he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things . . . and be killed,
and on the third day be raised."290 Peter scorns this prediction, nor
do the others understand it any better than he. 291 In this context
the mysterious episode of Jesus' Transfiguration takes place on a
high mountain,292 before three witnesses chosen by himself: Peter,
697, 2 600 James, and John. Jesus' face and clothes become dazzling with
light, and Moses and Elijah appear, speaking "of his departure,
which he was to accomplish at Jerusalem."293 A cloud covers him
440 and a voice from heaven says: "This is my Son, my Chosen; listen
to him! " 294
555
For a moment Jesus discloses his divine glory, confirming
Peter's confession. He also reveals that he will have to go by the
way of the cross at Jerusalem in order to "enter into his glory."295
2576, 2583 Moses and Elijah had seen God's glory on the Mountain; the Law
and the Prophets had announced the Messiah's sufferings . 296
Christ's Passion is the will of the Father: the Son acts as God's
257 servant;297 the cloud indicates the presence of the Holy Spirit. "The

whole Trinity appeared: the Father in the voice; the Son in the man;

You were transfigured on the mountain, and your disciples,
as much as they were capable of it, beheld your glory, 0
Christ our God, so tha t when they should see you crucified
they would understand tha t your Passion was voluntary,
and proclaim to the world that you truly are the splendor of
the Father. 299

556
On the threshold of the public life: the baptism; on the
threshold of the Passover: the Transfiguration. Jesus' baptism pro­
claimed "the mystery of the first regeneration," namely, our Baptism; the Transfiguration "is the sacrament of the second
regeneration": our own Resurrection. 300 From now on we share in
the Lord's Resurrection through the Spirit who acts in the sacra­
ments of the Body of Christ. The Transfiguration gives us a fore- 1 003
taste of Christ's glorious coming, when he "will change our lowly
body to be like his glorious body." 30 l But it also recalls that "it is
through many persecutions that we must enter the kingdom of
God": 302
Peter did not yet understand this when he wanted to remain
with Christ on the mountain. It has been reserved for you,
Peter, but for after death. For now, Jesus says: "Go down to
toil on earth, to serve on earth, to be scorned and crucified
on earth. Life goes down to be killed; Bread goes down to
suffer hunger; the Way goes down to be exhausted on his
journey; the Spring goes down to suffer thirst; and you refuse
303'
to suffer?"

Jesus' ascent to Jerusalem

557
"When the days drew near for him to be taken up [Jesus]
set his face to go to Jerusalem." 304 By this decision he indicated that
he was going up to Jerusalem prepared to die there. Three times he
had announced his Passion and Resurrection; now, heading to­
ward Jerusalem, Jesus says: "It cannot be that a prophet should
perish away from Jerusalem." 305
558
Jesus recalls the martyrdom of the prophets who had been
put to death in Jerusalem. Nevertheless he persists in calling Jeru­
salem to gather around him: "How often would I have gathered
your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings,
and you would not!" 306 When Jerusalem comes into view he weeps
over her and expresses once again his heart's desire: "Would that
even today you knew the things that make for peace! But now they
are hid from your eyes." 307
Jesus' messianic entrance into Jerusalem

559
How will Jerusalem welcome her Messiah? Although Je­
sus had always refused popular attempts to make him king, he
chooses the time and prepares the details for his messianic entry
into the city of "his father David." 308 Acclaimed as son of David,
as the one who brings salvation (Hosanna means "Save! " or "Give
salvation!"), the "King of glory" enters his City "riding on an
ass." 3°9 Jesus conquers the Daughter of Zion, a figure of his
Church, neither by ruse nor by violence, but by the humility that
bears witness to the truth. 310 And so the subjects of his kingdom
on that day are children and God's poor, who acclaim him as had
the angels when they announced him to the shepherds. 311 Their
333 acclamation, "Blessed be he who comes in the name of the
1 352 LORD," 312 is taken up by the Church in the "Sanctus" of the
Eucharistic liturgy that introduces the memorial of the Lord's
Passover.

love for people, his special affection for the little and
the poor, his acceptance of the total sacrifice on the
Cross for the redemption of the world, and his Resur­
rection are the actualization of his word and the ful­
fillment of Revelation" (John Paul II, CT 9).

562

Christ's disciples are to conform themselves to him until
he is formed in them (cf. Gal 4:19). "For this reason we,
who have been made like to him who have died with
him and risen with him are taken up into the mysteries
of his life, until we reign together with him " (LG 7 § 4).

No one, whether shepherd or wise man, can approach
God here below except by kneeling before the manger
at Bethlehem and adoring him hidden in the weakness
of a new-born child.

564

By his obedience to Mary and Joseph, as well as by his
humble work during the long years in Nazareth, Jesus
gives us the example of holiness in the daily life of
family and work.

565

From the beginning of his public life, at his baptism,
Jesus is the "Servant," wholly consecrated to the re­
demptive work that he will accomplish by the "bap­
tism" of his Passion.

566

The temptation in the desert shows Jesus, the humble
Messiah, who triumphs over Satan by his total adher­
ence to the plan of salvation willed by the Father.

The Kingdom of heaven was inaugurated on earth by
Christ. "This kingdom shone out before men in the
word, in the works, and in the presence of Christ" (LG
5). The Church is the seed and beginn ing of this king­
dom. Her keys are entrusted to Peter.

Christ's Transfiguration aims at strengthening the
apostles' faith in anticipation of his Passion: the ascent
onto the "high mountain" prepares for the ascent to
Calvary. Christ, Head of the Church, manifests what
his Body contains and radiates in the sacraments: "the
hope of glory" (Co/ 1:27; cf. St. Leo the Great, Sermo 51,
3: PL 54, 310c).

569

Jesus went up to Jerusalem voluntarily, knowing well
that there he would die a violent death because of the
opposition of sinners (d. Heb 12:3).

570

Jesus' entry into Jerusalem manifests the coming of the
kingdom that the Messiah-King, welcomed into his
city by children and the humble of heart, is going to
accomplish by the Passover of his Death and Resurrec­
tion.

ARTICLE 4
"JESUS CHRIST SUFFERED UNDER PONTIUS
PILATE, WAS CRUCIFIED, DIED, AND WAS BURIED"

571
The Paschal mystery of Christ's cross and Resurrection
stands at the center of the Good News that the apostles, and the
1 067 Church following them, are to proclaim to the world. God's saving
plan was accomplished "once for all"313 by the redemptive death
of his Son Jesus Christ.
572
The Church remains faithful to the interpretation of "all
the Scriptures" that Jesus gave both before and after his Passover:
599 "Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and
enter into his glory?"314 Jesus' sufferings took their historical,
concrete form from the fact that he was "rejected by the elders and
the chief priests and the scribes," who handed "him to the Gentiles
to be mocked and scourged and crucified. "315

Faith can therefore try to examine the circumstances of Jesus'
573
death, faithfully handed on by the Gospels316 and illuminated by

313 Heb 9:26.

Paragraph 1 . Jesus and Israel

574
From the beginning of Jesus' public ministry, certain
Pharisees and partisans of Herod together with priests and scribes
agreed together to destroy him.317 Because of certain of his acts 530
expelling demons, forgiving sins, healing on the sabbath day, his
novel interpretation of the precepts of the Law regarding purity,
and his familiarity with tax collectors and public sinners318 - some
ill-intentioned persons suspected Jesus of demonic possession.319
He is accused of blasphemy and false prophecy, religious crimes 591
which the Law punished with death by stoning. 320
-

Many of Jesus' deeds and words constituted a "sign of contradic­
ti on, 32 1 but more so for the religious authorities in Jerusalem, whom the
Gospel according to John often calls simply "the Jews," 322 than for the
ordinary People ofGod. 323 To be sure, Christ's relations with the Pharisees
were not exclusively polemical. Some Pharisees warned him of the danger
he was courting;3 2� Jesus praises some of them like the scribe of Mark
12:34, and dines several times at their homes. 325 Jesus endorses some of
the teachings imparted by this religious elite of God's people: the resur­
rection of the dead, 326 certain forms of piety (almsgiving, fasting, and
prayer),3 27 the custom of addressing God as Father, and the centrality of
the commandment to love God and neighbor. 328

575

"

576
In the eyes of many in Israet Jesus seems to be acting
against essential institutions of the Chosen People:

- submission to the whole of the Law in its written commandments
and, for the Pharisees, in the interpretation of oral tradition;
- the centrality of the Temple at Jerusalem as the holy place where
God's presence dwells in a special way;
- faith in the one God whose glory no man can share.

JESUS AND THE LAW

577
At the beginning of the Sermon on the Monnt Jesus issued
1 965 a solemn warning in which he presented God's law, given on Sinai
during the first covenant, in light of the grace of the New Covenant:

1 96 7

Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the
prophets: I have come not to abolish but to fulfill. For truly
I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter,
not one stroke of a letter, will pass from the law, until all is
accomplished. Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of
these commandments, and teaches others to do the same,
will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever
does them and teaches them will be called great in the
9
kingdom of heaven. 32

578
Jesus, Israel's Messiah and therefore the greatest in the
kingdom of heaven, was to fulfill the Law by keeping it in its
1 953 all-embracing detail - according to his own words, down to "the
least of these commandments." 330 He is in fact the only one who
could keep it perfectly. 331 On their own admission the Jews were
never able to observe the Law in its entirety without violating the
least of its precepts.332 This is why every year on the Day of
Atonement the children of Israel ask God's forgiveness for their
transgressions of the Law. The Law indeed makes up one insepa­
rable whole, and St. James recalls, "Whoever keeps the whole law
but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it." 333
579
This principle of integral observance of the Law not only in letter
but in spirit was dear to the Pharisees. By giving Israel this principle they
had led many Jews of Jesus' time to an extreme religious zeaJ.334 This zeal,
5'
were it not to lapse into "hypocritical" casuistry,33 could only prepare the
People for the unprecedented intervention of God through the perfect
33
fulfillment of the Law by the only Righteous One in place of all sinners. 6
580
The perfect fulfillment of the Law could be the work of
none but the divine legislator, born subject to the Law in the person
527 of the Son. 337 In Jesus, the Law no longer appears engraved on
tables of stone but "upon the heart" of the Servant who becomes
"a covenant to the people," because he will "faithfully bring forth

things written in the book of the Law, and do them/' for his death
took place to redeem them "from the transgressions under the first
covenant." 339
581

The Jewish people and their spiritual leaders viewed Jesus as a
rabbi. 340 He often argued within the framework of rabbinical interpreta­
tion of the Law. 341 Yet Jesus could not help but offend the teachers of the
Law, for he was not content to propose his interpretation alongside theirs
but taught the people "as one who had authority, and not as their
scribes. ''342 In Jesus, the same Word of God, that had resounded on Mount
Sinai to give the written Law to Moses, made itself heard anew on the
Mount of the Beatitudes. 343 Jesus did not abolish the Law but fulfilled it
by giving its ultimate interpretation in a divine way: "You have heard that
it was said to the men of old . . . . But I say to you . . . . "344 With this same
divine authority, he disavowed certain human traditions of the Pharisees
that were "making void the word of God."345

582
Going even further, Jesus perfects the dietary law, so impor­
tant in Jewish daily life, by revealing its ped agogical meaning through
a divine interpretation: "Whatever goes into a man from outside cannot
defile him . . . (Thus he declared all foods clean.). Wha t comes out of a
man is what defiles a man. For from within, out of the heart of man,
come evil thoughts . . . .'' 346 In p resenting with divine authority the
definitive interpreta tion of the Law, Jesus found himself confronted by
certain teachers of the Law who did not accep t his interp retation of the
Law guaranteed though it was by the d ivine signs that accompanied
7
it. 34 This was the case especially with the sabbath laws, for he recalls
often with rabbinical arguments, tha t the sabbath rest is not violated by
serving God and neighbor, 348 which his own healings did.

Like the prophets before him Jesus expressed the deepest
respect for the Temple in Jerusalem. It was in the Temple that

parents that he must be about his Father's business. 350 He went
there each year during his hidden life at least for Passover. 351 His
public ministry itself was patterned by his pilgrimages to Jerusa­
lem for the great Jewish feasts. 352
584
Jesus went up to the Temple as the privileged place of
encounter with God. For him, the Temple was the dwelling of his
2599 Father, a house of prayer, and he was angered that its outer court
had become a place of commerce. 353 He drove merchants out of it
because of jealous love for his Father: "You shall not make my Father's
house a house of trade. His disciples remembered that it was written,
'Zeal for your house will consume me."'354 After his Resurrection his
apostles retained their reverence for the Temple. 355
585
On the threshold of his Passion Jesus announced the coming
destruction of this splendid building, of which there would not
remain "one stone upon another."356 By doing so, he announced a
sign of the last days, which were to begin with his own Passover. 357
But this prophecy would be distorted in its telling by false witnesses
during his interrogation at the high priest's house and would be
thrown back at him as an insult when he was nailed to the cross.358
586
Far from having been hostile to the Temple, where he gave
the essential part of his teaching, Jesus was willing to pay the
temple-tax, associating with him Peter, whom he had just made the
foundation of his future Church. 359 He even identified himself
with the Temple by presenting himself as God's definitive dwell797 ing-place among men. 360 Therefore his being put to bodily death361
presaged the destruction of the Temple, which would manifest the
dawning of a new age in the history of salvation: "The hour is
coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you
1 1 79 worship the Father."362

jESUS AND ISRAEL'S FAITH IN THE ONE GoD AND SAVIOR

587
If the Law and the Jerusalem Temple could be occasions
of opposition to Jesus by Israel's religious authorities, his role in
the redemption of sins, the divine work par excellence, was the true
stumbling -block for them. 363
588
Jesus scandalized the Pharisees by eating with tax collec­
tors and sinners as familiarly as with themselves. 364 Against those
among them "who trusted in themselves that they were righteous
and despised others," Jesus affirmed: "I have not come to call the 545
righteous, but sinners to repentance." 365 He went further by pro­
claiming before the Pharisees that, since sin is universal, those who
pretend not to need salvation are blind to themselves. 366
589
Jesus gave scandal above all when he identified his merciful conduct toward sinners with God's own attitude toward
them. 367 He went so far as to hint that by sharing the table of sinners
he was admitting them to the messianic banquet. 368 But it was most
especially by forgiving sins that Jesus placed the religious authorities of Israel on the hams of a dilemma. Were they not entitled to
demand in consternation, "Who can forgive sins but God
alone?" 369 By forgiving sins Jesus either is blaspheming as a man 43 1, 1441
who made himself God's equal or is speaking the truth, and his 432
person really does make present and reveal God's name. 370
590
Only the divine identity of Jesus' person can justify so
absolute a claim as "He who is not with me is against me"; and his
saying that there was in him "something greater than Jonah, . . .
greater than Solomon,"something "greater than the Temple"; his
reminder that David had called the Messiah his Lord, 371 and his
affirmations, "Before Abraham was, I AM"; and even "I and the
253
Father are one." 372

591
Jesus asked the religious authorities ofJerusalem to believe
in him because of the Father's works which he accomplished. 373
But such an act of faith must go through a mysterious death to self,
52 6 for a new "birth from above" under the influence of divine grace. 374
Such a demand for conversion in the face of so surprising a fulfill­
ment of the promises 375 allows one to understand the Sanhedrin's
tragic misunderstanding of Jesus: they judged that he deserved the
death sentence as a blasphemer. 376 The members of the Sanhedrin
were thus acting at the same time out of "ignorance" and the
574 "hardness" of their "unbelief." 377

IN BRIEF
592

Jesus did not abolish the Law of Sinai, but rather fulfilled
it (d. Mt 5:17-19) with such perfection (cf. fn 8:46) that he
revealed its ultimate meaning (cf. Mt 5:33) and redeemed
the transgressions against it (cf. Heb 9:15).

593

Jesus venerated the Temple by going up to it for the
Jewish feasts of pilgrimage, and with a jealous love he
loved this dwelling of God among men. The Temple
prefigures his own mystery. When he announces its
destruction, it is as a manifestation of his own execution
and of the entry into a new age in the history of salvation,
when his Body would be the definitive Temple.

594

Jesus performed acts, such as pardoning sins, that mani­
fested him to be the Savior God himself (cf. Jn 5:16-18).
Certain Jews, who did not recognize God made man (d.
Jn 1:14), saw in him only a man who made himself God
Un 10:33), and judged him as a blasphemer.

THE TRIAL OF JESUS

Divisions among the Jewish authorities concerning Jesus

595
Among the religious authorities of Jerusalem, not only were the
Pharisee Nicodemus and the prominent Joseph of Arimathea both secret
disciples of Jesus, but there was also long-standing dissension about him,
so much so that St. John says of these authorities on the very eve of Christ's
Passion, "many . . . believed in him," though very imperfectly.378 This is
not surprising, if one recalls that on the day after Pentecost "a great many
of the priests were obedient to the faith" and "some believers . . . belonged
to the party of the Pharisees," to the point that St. James could tell St. Paul,
"How many thousands there are among the fews of those who have
believed; and they are all zealous for the Law." 379
596
The religious authorities in erusalem were not unanimous about
what stance to take toward Jesus. 38 The Pharisees threatened to excom­
municate his followers. 381 To those who feared that "everyone will believe
in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our holy place and
our nation, " the high priest Caiap�s replied by prophesying: "It is expedient for you tha:t one man should die for the people, and that the whole
nation should not perfsh." 382 The Sanhedrin, having declared Jesus de­
serving of death as a blasphemer but having lost the right to put anyone
to death, hands him over to the Romans, accusing him of political revolt,
a charge that puts him in the same category as Barabbas who had been
accused of sedition.383 The high priests also threatened Pilate politically
so that he would condemn Jesus to death.384

Jews are not collectively responsible for Jesus' death

The historical complexity of Jesus' trial is apparent in the
Gospel accounts. The personal sin of the participants Uudas, the

responsibility for the trial on the Jews in Jerusalem as a whole,
despite the outcry of a manipulated crowd and the global re­
proaches contained in the apostles' calls to conversion after Pente­
cost. 385 Jesus himself, in forgiving them on the cross, and Peter in 1 735

following suit, both accept "the ignorance" of the Jews of Jerusalem
and even of their leaders. 386 Still less can we extend responsibility
to other Jews of different times and places, based merely on the
crowd's cry: "His blood be on us and on our children!" a formula
for ratifying a judicial sentence. 387 As the Church declared at the
Second Vatican Council:
. . . [N]either all Jews indiscriminately at that time, nor Jews
today, can be charged with the crimes committed during his
Passion. . . . [T]he Jews should not be spoken of as r ected
or accursed as if this followed from holy Scripture. 38

All sinners were the authors of Christ's Passion

598
In her Magisterial teaching of the faith and in the witness
of her saints, the Church has never forgotten that "sinners were the
authors and the ministers of all the sufferings that the divine
Redeemer endured."389 Taking into account the fact that our sins
affect Christ himsel£,390 the Church does not hesitate to impute to
Christians the gravest responsibility for the torments inflicted
upon Jesus, a responsibility with which they have all too often
burdened the Jews alone:

We must regard as guilty all those who continue to relapse
into their sins. Since our sins made the Lord Christ suffer the
torment of the cross, those who plunge themselves into
disorders and crimes crucify the Son of God anew in their
hearts (for he is in them) and hold him up to contempt. And
it can be seen that our crime in this case is greater in us than
in the Jews. As for them, according to the witness of the
Apostle, "None of the rulers of__this age understood thisijor
if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."
We, however, profess to know him. And when we deny him
by our deeds, we in some way seem to lay violent hands on
him. 391
Nor did demons crucify him; it is you who have crucified
him and crucify him still, when you delight in your vices and
sins. 392

CHRIST'S REDEMPTIVE DEATH IN GOD'S PLAN
OF SALVA TION

"Jesus handed over according to the definite plan of God"

599
Jesus' violent death was not the result of chance in an unfor­
tlli1ate coincidence of circumstances, but is part of the mystery of
God's plan, as St. Peter explains to the Jews of Jerusalem in his first 51 7
sermon on Pentecost: "This Jesus [was] delivered up according to the
de� plan and foreknowledge of God."393 This Biblical language
does not mean that those who handed him over were merely passive
players in a scenario written in advance by God.394
600
To God, all moments of time are present in their immediacy. When therefore he establishes his eternal plan of "predestina­
tion," he includes in it each person's free response to his grace: "In
this city, in fact, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles
and the peoples of Israel, gathered together against your holy
servant Jesus, whom you anointed, to do whatever your hand and
your plan had predestined to take place. " 395 For the sake of accom­
plishing his e_lan of salvation, God permitted the acts that flowed 3 1 2
fro �heir blindness.39b

------ -

"He died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures"

601
The Scriptures had foE!Qld this divine plan of salvation
through the putting to death of "the righteous one, my Servant" as
a mystery of universal redemption, that is, as the ransom that
would free men from the slavery of sin.397 Citing a confession--of
faith that he himself had "received," St. Paul professes that "Christ
died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures." 398 In particular
Jesus' redemptive death fulfills Isaiah's prophecy of the suffering 652
Servant. 399 Indeed Jesus himself e ained the meaning of his life
and death in the light of God's suffering Servant. 40° After his 713
Resurrection he gave this interpretation of the Scriptures to the
disciples at Emmaus, and then to the apostles.401

"For our sake God made him to be sin"

Consequently, St. Peter can formulate the apostolic faith in
602
the divine plan of salvation in this way: "You were ransomed from
the futile ways inherited from your fathers . . . with the precious
blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. He was
destined before the foundation of the world but was made manifest
' at the end of the times for your sake." 402 Man's sins, following on
400 original sin, are punishable by death. 403 By sending his own Son
51 9 in the form of a_slave, in the form of a fallen humanity, on a<;_<::�unt
of sin, God "made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him
we �ight become the righteousness of God." 404
603
Jesus did not experience reprobation as if he himself had
sinned. 405 But in the redeeming love that always united him to the
Father, he assumed us in the state of our waywardness of sin, to
the point that he could say in our name from the c;os s: ''My God,
my God, why have you forsaken me?" 406 Having thus established
2572 him in solidarity with us sinner?, God "did not spare his own Son
but gave him up for us all," so that.we might be "reconciled to G �d
by the death of his Son." 407

God takes the initiative of universal redeeming love

604
By giving up his own Son for our sins, God manifests that his
plan for us is one of benevolent love, prior to any merit on our part:
2 1 1 , 2009 "In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent
1 825 his Son to be the expiation for our sins." 408 God "shows his love for
us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us."409
605
At the end of the parable of the lost sheep Jesus recalled
that God's love excludes no one: "So it is not the will of your Father
who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish." 410 He
affirms that he came "to give his life as a ransom for many"; this
last term is not restrictive, but contrasts the whole of humanity with

CHRIST OFFERED HIMSELF TO HIS FATHER FOR OUR SINS

Christ's whole life is an o ffe ring to the Father

606
The Son of God, who came down "from heaven, not to do
[his] own will, but the will of him who sent [him],"413 said on
coming into the world, "Lo, I have come to do your will, 0 God." 517
/; "And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of
1
( the body of Jesus Christ once for all."4 4 From the first moment of
his Incarnation the Son embraces the Father's plan of divine salva­
tion in his redemptive mission: "My food is to do the will of him
who sent me, and to accomplish his work."415 The sacrifice of Jesus
"for the sins of the whole world"4 16 expresses his loving commun- 536
ion with the Father. "The Father loves me, because I lay down my
life," said the Lord, " [for] I do as the Father has commanded me,
so that the world may know that I love the Father."417
607
The desire to embrace his Fat:h_er's plan of redeemiEgJove
inspired Jesus' whole life,418 for his redemptive passion was the
very reason for his Incarnation. And so he asked, "And what shall 457
I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? No, for this purpose I have
come to this hour:•419 And again, "Shall I not drink the cup which
the Father has given me?"420 From the cross, just before "It is
finished," he said, "I thirst." 421
"The Lamb who takes away the sin of the world"

608
After agreeing to baptize him along with the sinners, John
the Baptist looked at Jesus and pointed him out as the "Lamb of
God, who takes away the sin of the world . " 422 By doing so, he 523

reveals that Jesus is at the same time the suffering Servant who silently
allows himself to be led to the slaughter and who bears the sin of the
51 7 multitudes, and also the Paschal Lamb, the symbol oflsrael's redemp­
tion at the first Passover.423 Christ's whole life expresses his mission:
"to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many." 424
Jesus freely embraced the Father's redeeming love

609
By embracing in his human heart the Father's love for men,
Jesus "loved them to the end," for "greater love has no man than
this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." 425 In suffering
478 and death his humanity became the free and perfect instrument of
51 5 his divine love which desires the salvation of men. 426 Indeed, out
2 72, 539 of love for his Father and for men, whom the Father wants to save,
Jesus freely accepted his Passion and death: "No one takes [my life]
from me, but I lay it down of my own accord." 427 Hence the
sovereign freedom of God's Son as he went out to his death. 428
At the Last Supper Jesus anticipated the free offering of his life

610
Jesus gave the supreme expression of his free offering of
himself at the meal shared with the twelve Apostles "on the night
7 66 he was betrayed. " 429 On the eve of his Passion, while still free, Jesus
1337 transformed this Last Supper with the apostles into the memorial
of his voluntary offering to the Father for the salvation of men:
"This is my body which is given for you." "This is my blood of the
covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of
sins." 430
611
The Eucharist that Christ institutes at that moment will be the
memorial of his sacrifice.431 Jesus includes the apostles in his own
1 364 offering and bids them perpetuate it. 432 By doing so, the Lord insti1 341, 1566 tutes his apostles as priests of the New Covenant: "For their sakes I
sanctify myself, so that they also may be sanctified in truth."433

The agony at Gethsemani

612
The cup of the New Covenant, which Jesus anticipated
when he offered himself at the Last Supper, is afterwards accepted
by him from his Father's hands in his agony in the garden at
Gethsemani,434 making himself "obedient unto death." Jesus 532, 2600
prays: "My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me . . . . "435
Thus he expresses the horror that death represented for his human
nature. Like ours, his human nature is destined for eternal life; but
unlike ours, it is perfectly exempt from sin, the cause of death.436
Above all, his human nature has been assumed by the divine person
of the "Author of life," the "Living One."437 By accepting in his human
will that the Father's will be done, he accepts his death as redemptive,
1 009
for "he himself bore our sins in his body on the tree." 438
Christ's death is the unique and definitive sacrifice

613
Christ's death is both the Paschal sacrifice that accomplishes
the definitive redemption of men, through "the Lamb of God, who
takes away the sin of the world," 439 and the sacrifice of the New 1 366
Covenant, which res!_g:res man to sommunion with God by recon- 2009
cilmg_him to God through the "blood of the covenant, which was
poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." 440
614
This sacrifice of Christ is unique; it completes and sur- 529, 1330
passes all other sacrifices. 441 First, it is a gift from God the Father 2 1 00
himself, for the Father handed his Son over to sinners in order to
reconcile us with himself. At the same time it is the offering of the
Son of God made man, who in freedom and love offered his life to
his Father through the Holy Spirit in reparation for our disobedience. 442

Jesus substitutes his obedience for our di s obedience

615
"For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners,
so by one man's obedience many will be made righteous."443 By his
1 850 obedience unto death, Jesus accomplished the substitution of the
suffering Servant, who "makes himself an offeringfor sin," when "he
433 bore the sin of many," and who "shall make many to be accounted
41 1 righteous," for "he shall bear their iniquities."444 Jesus atoned for our
faults and made satisfaction for our sins to the Father.445
Jesus consummates his sacrifice on the Cross

616
It is love "to the end"446 that confers on Christ's sacrifice
its value as redep1.ption and reparation, as aton�mEtnt and satisfac­
tion. He knew and loved us all when he offered his life. 447 Now
478 "the love of Christ controls us, because we are convinced that one
has died for all; therefore all have died." 448 No man, not even the
holiest, was ever able to take on himself the sins of all me_n Cllld offer
himself as a sacrifice for all. The existence in Christ of the divine
468 person of the Son, who at once surpasses and embraces all human
51 9 persons and constitutes himself as the Head of all mankind, makes
possible his redemptive sacrifice for all.
617
The Council of Trent emphasizes the unique character of
Christ's sacrifice as "the source of eternal salvation" 449 and teaches
1 992 that "his most holy Passion on the wood of the cross merited
1 235 justification for us."450 And the Church venerates his cross as it
sings: "Hail, 0 Cross, our only hope."451
Our participation in Christ's sacrifice
618
The cross is the unique sacrifice of Christ, the "one media­

" take up [their] cross and follow [him],"454 for "Christ also suffered 307, 2100
for [us], leaving [us] an example so that [we] should follow in his
steps." 455 In fact Jesus desires to associate with his redeeming
sacrifice those who were to be its first beneficiaries. 456 This is 964
achieved supremely in the case of his mother, who was associated
more intimately than any other person in the mystery of his redemptive suffering. 457
Apart from the cross there is no other ladder by which we
may get to heaven. 458

IN BRIEF
619

"Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scrip­
tures" (1 Cor 15:3).

620

Our salvation flows from God's initiative of love for
us, because "he loved us and sent his Son to be the
expiation for our sins" (1 Jn 4:10). "God was in Christ
reconciling the world to himself" (2 Cor 5: 19).

621

Jesus freely offered himself for our salvation. Before­
hand, during the Last Supper, he both symbolized this
offering and made it really present: "This is my body
which is given for you" (Lk 22:19).

622

The redemption won by Christ consists in this, that he
came "to give his life as a ransom for many" (Mt 20:28),
that is, he "loved [his own] to the end" (Jn 13:1), so that
they might be "ransomed from the futile ways inher­
ited from [their] fathers (1 Pet 1 : 18).
"

623

By his loving obedience to the Father, "unto death,
even death on a cross" (Phil 2:8), Jesus fulfills the
atoning mission (cf. Isa 53:10) of the suffering Servant,
who will "make many righteous; and he shall bear
their iniquities" (Isa 53:11; cf. Rom 5:19).

Paragraph 3 . Jesu s Christ Was Buried

624
"By the grace of God" Jesus tasted death "for every
one."459 In his plan of salvation, God ordained that his Son should
not only "die for our sins"46° but should also "taste death," expe1 005, 362 rience the condition of death, the separation of his soul from his
body, between the time he expired on the cross and the time he was
raised from the dead. The state of the dead Christ is the mystery of
the tomb and the descent into hell. It is the mystery of Holy
Saturday, when Christ, lying in the tomb,461 reveals God's great
349 sabbath rest462 after the fulfillment463 of man's salvation, which
brings peace to the whole universe. 464
Christ in the tomb in his body

625
Christ's stay in the tomb constitutes the real link between
his passible state before Easter and his glorious and risen state
today. The same person of the "Living One" can say, "I died, and
behold I am alive for evermore": 465
God [the Son] did not impede death from separating his soul
from his body according to the necessary order of nature, but
has reunited them to one another in the Resurrection, so that

he himself might be, in his person, the meeting pointfor death and
life, by arresting in himself the decomposition of nature

produced by death and so becoming the source of reunion
for the separated parts. 466

626
Since the "Author of life" who was killed467 is the same
470, 650 "living one [who has] risen," 468 the divine person of the Son of God
necessarily continued to possess his human soul and body, sepa­
rated from each other by death:
By the fact that at Christ's death hls soul was separated from
his flesh, his one person is not itself divided into two persons;
for the human body and soul of Christ have existed in the
same way from the beginning of his earthly existence, in the
divine person of the Word; and in death, although separated

from each other, both remained with one and the same
person of the Word.4 69

"You will not let your Holy One see corruption"

627

Christ's death was a real death in that it put an end to his

earthly human existence. But because of the union which the person

of the Son retained with his body, his was not a mortal corpse like
others, for "it was not possible for death to hold him"470 and therefore
"divine power preserved Christ's body from corruption."471 Both of

1 009
1 683

these statements can be said of Christ: "He was cut off out of the land
of the living,"472 and "My flesh will dwell in hope. For you will not
abandon my soul to Hades, nor let your Holy One see corruption."473

Jesus' Resurrection "on the third day'' was the sign of this also,

because bodily decay was held to begin on the fourth day after

death.474

"Buried with Christ

."

Bap tism, the original and full sign of which is immersion,

efficaciously signifies the descent into the tomb by the Christian
who dies to sin with Christ in order to live a new life. "We were

buried therefore with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ

was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, w e too might
walk in newness of life."475

IN BRIEF
629

To the benefit of every man, Jesus Christ tasted death
(cf.

Heb 2:9) . It is truly the Son of God made man who

died and was buried.

630

During Christ's period in the tomb, his divine person
continued to assume both his soul and his body, al­
though they were separated from each other by death.

For this reason the dead Christ's body " saw no corrup­
tion"

ARTICLE 5
"HE DES CENDED INTO HELL
ON THE THIRD DAY HE ROSE A GAIN"

631

Jesus " descended into the lower parts of the earth. He who

descended is he who also ascended far above all the heavens . "476

The Apostles' Creed confesses in the same article Chris t's descent
into hell and his Resurrection from the dead on the third day,

because in his Passover it was precisely out of the depths of death
that he made life spring forth:

Christ, that Morning Star, who came back from the dead,
and shed his peaceful light on all mankind,
your Son who lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen.477

Paragraph 1 . Ch ri s t Descended into Hell

632

The frequent New Testament affirmations that Jesus was

"raised from the dead" presuppose that the crucified one sojourned
in the realm of the dead prior to his resurrection.478 This was the first

meaning given in the apostolic preaching to Christ's descent into hell:

that Jesus, like all men, experienced death and in his soul joined the
others in the realm of the dead . But he descended there as Savior,
proclaiming the Good News to the spirits imprisoned there.479

633

Scripture calls the abode of the dead, to which the dead

Christ went down, "hell"

-

Sheol in

Hebrew or

Hades

in Greek -

because those who are there are deprived of the vision of God.480
Such is the case for all the dead, whether evil or righteous, while

they await the redeemer: which does not mean that their lot is

identical, as Jesus shows through the parable of the poor man
Lazarus who was received into " Abraham's bosom": 481 "It is pre­

cisely these holy souls, who awaited their Savior in Abraham's
bosom, whom Christ the Lord delivered when he descended into
1 033 hell. "482 Jesus did not descend into hell to deliver the damned, nor
to destroy the hell of damnation, but to free the just who had gone

before him . 4 83

"The gospel was preached even to the dead."484 The descent

into hell brings the Gospel message of salvation to complete fulfill­
ment. This is the last phase of Jesus' messianic mission, a phase which

is condensed in time but vast in its real significance: the spread of
Christ's redemptive work to all men of all times and all places, for all

who are saved have been made sharers

635

in the redemption.

Christ went down into the dep ths of death so that "the

dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear w ill
live ." 485 Jesus, " the Author of life," by dying destroyed "him who

has the power of death, tha t is, the devil, and [delivered ] all those
who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage . "486
Henceforth the risen Christ holds "the keys of Death and Hades,"

so that "at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and
on earth and under the earth."487
Today a great silence reigns on earth, a great silence and a great
stillness. A great silence because the King is asleep. The earth
trembled and is still because God has fallen asleep in the flesh
and he has raised up all who have slept ever since the world
began . . . . He has gone to search for Adam, our first father, as
for a lost sheep. Greatly desiring to visit those who live in
darkness and in the shadow of death, he has gone to free from
sorrow Adam in his bonds and Eve, captive with him - He who
is both their God and the son of Eve. . . . "I am your God, who
for your sake have become your son. . . . I order you, 0 sleeper,
to awake. I did not create you to be a prisoner in hell. Rise from
the dead, for I am the life of the dea d. "488

IN BRIEF
636

By the expression "He descended into hell," the Apos­
tles' Creed confesses that Jesus did really die and

through his death for us conquered death and the devil
"who has the power of death"

637

(Heb 2:14).

In his human soul united to his divine person, the dead

Christ went down to the realm of the dead. He opened

heaven's gates for the just who had gone before him.

Paragraph 2. On the Third Day He Rose from the Dead
"We bring you the good news that what God promised to the
fathers, this day he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Je­
sus."489 The Resurrection of Jesus is the crowning truth of our faith in

638

90 Christ, a faith believed and lived as the central truth by the first
651 Christian community; handed on as fundamental by Tradition; estab991 lished by the documents of the New Testament; and preached as an
essential part of the Paschal mystery along with the cross:

Christ is risen from the dead!
Dying, he conquered death;
To the dead, he has given life. 490

THE HISTORICAL AND TRANSCENDENT EVENT

639

The mystery of Christ's resurrection is a real event, with

manifestations that were historically verified, as the New Testa­
ment bears witness.

In

about a.d. 56, St. Paul could already write

to the Corinthians: "I delivered to you as of first importance what

I also received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the

scriptures, and that he was buried, that he was raised on the third

day in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to
Cephas, then to the Twelve . . . "4 9 1 The Apostle speaks here of the

living tradition of the Resurrection which he had learned after his
conversion at the gates of Damascus. 492

The empty tomb

640

"Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not

here, but has risen . "493 The first element we encounter in the

framework of the Easter events is the empty tomb.

In itself it is not

a direct proof of Resurrection; the absence of Christ's body from
the tomb could be explained otherwise.4 94 Nonetheless the empty
tomb was still an essential sign for all. Its discovery by the disciples

was the first step toward recognizing the very fact of the Resurrec­

tion. This was the case, first with the holy women, and then with

Peter. 4 95 The d isciple "whom Jesus loved" affirmed that when he

entered the empty tomb and discovered "the linen cloths lying
there," "he saw and believed . "496 This suggests that he realized

from the empty tomb 's condi tion that the absence of Jesus' body

could not have been of human doing and that Jesus had not simply
999
returned to earthly life as had been the case with Lazarus.49 7

The appearances of the Risen One

641

Mary Magdalene and the holy women who came to finish

anointing the body of Jesus, which had been buried in haste be­

cause the Sabbath began on the evening of Good Friday, were the
first to encounter the Risen One.498 Thus the women were the first
messengers of Christ's Resurrection for the apostles themselves .499

They were the next to whom Jesus appears: first Peter, then the

Twelve. Peter had been called to strengthen the faith of his broth- 553
ers, 500 and so sees the Risen One before them; it is on the b asis of

his testimony that the community exclaims: "The Lord has risen 448
indeed, and has appeared to Simon ! " 50 1

642

Everything that happened during those Paschal days in­

volves each of the apostles - and Peter in particula r - in the building
of the new era begun on Easter morning. As witnesses of the Risen

One, they remain the foundation stones of his Church . The faith of 659, 881
the first community of believers is based on the witness of concrete

men known to the Christians and for the most part still living
among them. Peter and the Twelve are the primary "witnesses to

his Resurrection," but they are not the only ones - Paul speaks 860

clearly of more than five hundred persons to whom Jesus appeared
on a single occasion and also of James and of all the apostles .502

643
Given all these testimonies, Christ's Resurrection cannot be inter­
preted as something outside the physical order, and it is impossible not to
acknowledge it as an historical fact. It is clear from the facts that the disciples'
faith was drastically put to the test by their master's Passion and death on the
cross, which he had foretold. 503 The shock provoked by the Passion was so
great that at least some of the disciples did not at once believe in the news of
the Resurrection. Far from showing us a community seized by a mystical
exaltation, the Gospels present us with disciples demoralized ("looking
sad"5 04 ) and frightened. For they had not believed the holy women returning

from the tomb and had regarded their words as an "idle tale."505 When
Jesus reveals himself to the Eleven on Easter evening, "he upbraided them for
their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who
saw him after he had risen."506

644
Even when faced with the reality of the risen Jesus the disciples
are still doubtful, so impossible did the thing seem: they thought they were
seeing a ghost. "In their joy they were still disbelieving and still wonder­
ing." 50 7 Thomas will also experience the test of doubt and St. Matthew
relates that during the risen Lord's last appearance in Galilee "some
doubted." 508 Therefore the hypothesis that the Resurrection was pro­
duced by the apostles' faith (or credulity) will not hold up. On the contrary
their faith in the Resurrection was born, under the action of divine grace,
from their direct experience of the reality of the risen Jesus.
The condition of Christ's risen humanity

645

By means of touch and the sharing of a meat the risen Jesus

establishes direct contact with his disciples. He invites them in this
way to recognize that he is not a ghost and above all to verify that

999 the risen body in which he appears to them is the same body that
had been tortured and crucified, for it still bears the traces of his
passion. 509 Yet at the same time this authentic, real body possesses
the new properties of a glorious body: not limited by space and
time but able to be present how and when he wills; for Christ's
humanity can no longer be confined to earth and belongs hence­
forth only to the Father's divine realm. 5 1 0 For this reason too the
risen Jesus enjoys the sovereign freedom of appearing as he wishes:

in the guise of a gardener or in other forms familiar to his disciples,
precisely to awaken their faith.5 1 1

646

Christ's Resurrection was not a return to earthly life, as was

the case with the raisings from the dead that he had performed before
Easter: Jairus' daughter, the young man of Nairn, Lazarus. These
actions were miraculous events, but the persons miraculously raised

934 returned by Jesus' power to ordinary earthly life. At some particular
549 moment they would die again. Christ's Resurrection is essentially
different. In his risen body he passes from the state of death to another
life beyond time and space. At Jesus' Resurrection his body is filled

with the power of the Holy Spirit: he shares the divine life in his glorious

state, so that St. Paul can say that Christ is "the man of heaven."512

The Resurrection as transcendent event

647

0 truly blessed Night, sings the Exsultet of the Easter Vigil,

which alone deserved to know the time and the hour when Christ
rose from the realm of the dead ! 5 13 But no one was an eyewitness
to Christ's Resurrection and no evangelist describes it. No one can
say how it came about physically. Still less was its innermost

1 000

essence, his passing over to another life, perceptible to the senses.
Although the Resurrection was an historical event that could be
verified by the sign of the empty tomb and by the reality of the
apostles' encounters with the risen Christ, still it remains at the very

heart of the mystery of faith as something that transcends and sur­
passes history. This is why the risen Christ does not reveal himself to
the world, but to his disciples, "to those who came up with him from

Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people .'• 514

II.

THE RESURRECTION - A WORK OF THE HOLY TRINITY

648

Christ's Resurrection is an object of faith in that it is a tran­

scendent intervention of God himself in creation and history.

In it the

three divine persons act together as one, and manifest their own

258, 989

proper characteristics. The Father's power "raised up" Christ his Son
and by doing so perfectly introduced his Son's humanity, including
his body, into the Trinity. Jesus is conclusively revealed as "Son of

663
445

God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his Resurrection 272
from the dead ."5 1 5 St. Paul insists on the manifestation of God's
power516 through the working of the Spirit who gave life to Jesus'
dead humanity and called it to the glorious state of Lordship.

649

As for the Son, he effects his own Resurrection by virtue of his

divine power. Jesus announces t.�t the Son of man will have to suffer
much, die, and then rise.517 Elsewhere he affirms explicitly: "I lay down
my life, that

I may take it again. . . I have power to lay it down, and I
.

have power to take it again."5 18 "We believe that Jesus died and rose
again."5 19

626 650
The Fathers contemplate the Resurrec tion from the per1 005 spective of the divine person of Christ who remained united to his

soul and body, even when these were separated from each other

by death: "By the unity of the divine nature, which remains present
in each of the two components of man, these are reunited . For as

death is produced by the separation of the human components, so
Resurrection is achieved by the union of the two ." 52 0

Ill.

THE MEANING AND SAVING SIGNIFICANCE
OF THE RESURRECTION

651

"If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain

and your faith is in vain." 521 The Resurrection above all constitutes

the confirmation of all Christ's works and teachings. All truths,

129 even those most inaccessible to human reason, find their justifica274 tion if Christ by his Resurrection has given the definitive proof of
his divine authority, which he had promised .

652

Christ's Resurrection is the fulfillment of the promises

994, 601 both of the Old Testament and of Jesus himself during his earthly
life . 522 The phrase "in accordance with the Scriptures" 523 indicates
that Christ's Resurrection fulfilled these predictions.

445 653

The truth of Jesus' divinity is confirmed by his Resurrec-

tion . He had said : "When you have lifted up the Son of man, then
you will know that I am he. "524 The Resurrection of the crucified
one shows that he was truly "I Am, " the Son of God and God

himself. So St. Paul could declare to the Jews: "What God promised

to the fathers, this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising

Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm, 'You are my Son,
today I have begotten you ."' 525 Christ's Resurrection is closely
linked to the Incarnation of God's Son and is its fulfillment in

46t 422 accordance with God's eternal plan.

654

The Paschal mystery has two aspects: by his death, Christ

liberates us from sin; by his Resurrection, he opens for us the way
to a new life. This new life is above all justification that reinstates

The Profession of Faith

u s in God's grace, "so tha t a s Christ was raised from the dead b y
the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. " 526

1 987

Justification consists in both victory over the death caused by sin
and a new participation in grace. 527 It b rings about filial adop tion
so tha t men become Christ's brethren, as Jesus himself called his
disciples after his Resurrection: "Go and tell my brethren. " 528 We

1 996

are bre thren not by nature, but by the gift of grace, because that
adop tive filia tion gains us a real share

in the life of the only Son,

which was fully revealed in his Resurrec tion.

655

Finally, Christ's Resurrection - and the risen Chris t himself -

is the principle and source of our future resurrection: "Christ has been
raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.
For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive." 529

.

.

989

.

The risen Christ lives in the hearts of his faithful while they await that
fulfillment. In Christ, Christians "have tasted . . . the powers of the age
to come"530 and their lives are swept up by Christ into the heart of
divine life, so that they may "live no longer for themselves but for him
who for their sake died and was raised ." 531

IN B RIEF
656

Faith in the Resurrection has as its object an event
which is historically attested to by the disciples, who
really encountered the Risen One . At the same time,
this event is mys teriously transcendent insofar as it is
the entry of Christ's humanity into the glory of God.

657

The empty tomb and the linen cloths lying there sig­
nify in themselves that by God's power Christ's body
had escaped the bonds of death and corruption. They
prepared the disciples to encounter the Risen Lord.

658

Christ, "the first-bam from the dead"

(Co/ 1:18),

is the

principle of our own resurrection, even now by the
justification of our souls

"HE A SCENDED INTO HEA VEN AND IS SEA TED
AT THE RIGHT HAND OF THE FATHER"

659

"So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was

taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God." 532
Christ's body was glorified at the moment of his Resurrection, as

645

proved by the new and supernatural properties it subsequently
and permanently enjoys .533 But during the forty days when he eats
and drinks familiarly with his disciples and teaches them about the
kingdom, his glory remains veiled under the appearance of ordi­

nary hurnanity.534 Jesus' final apparition ends with the irreversible

66
697
642

entry of his humanity into divine glory, symbolized by the cloud
and by heaven, where he is seated from that time forward at God's

right hand . 535 Only in a wholly exceptional and unique way would

Jesus show himself to Paul "as to one untimely born," in a last
apparition that established him as an apostle. 536

660

The veiled character of the glory of the Risen One during

this time is intimated in his mysterious words to Mary Magdalene:

"I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren and

say to them, I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my
God and your God. "537 This indicates a difference in rnanifesta tion
between the glory of the risen Christ and that of the Christ exalted
to the Father's right hand, a transition marked by the historical and
transcendent event of the Ascension.

661
461

This final stage stays closely l inked to the first, that is, to

his descent from heaven in the Incarna tion. Only the one who
"carne from the Father" can return to the Father: Christ Jesus . 538
"No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from

heaven, the Son of rnan." 539 Left to its own natural powers human­
ity does not have access to the "Father's house," to God's life and

792

happiness .540 Only Christ can open to man such access that we, his
members, might have confidence that we too shall go where he, our
Head and our Source, has preceded us.541

"And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all

men to mysel£." 542 The lifting up of Jesus on the cross signifies and
announces his lifting up by his Ascension into heaven, and indeed

begins it. Jesus Christ, the one priest of the new and eternal Cove-

1545

nant, "entered, not into a sanctuary made by human hands . . . but

into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our
behal£." 543 There Christ permanently exercises his pries thood, for

he "always lives to make intercession" for "those who draw near
to God through him . " 544 As "high priest of the good things to

come" he is the center and the p rincipal actor of the liturgy that 1 1 37

honors the Father in heaven. 545

663

Henceforth Christ is seated at

the right hand of the Father: "By

'the Father's right hand' we unders tand the glory and honor of

divinity, where he who exists as Son of God before all ages, indeed

as God, of one being with the Father, is seated bodily after he
became incarnate and his flesh was glorified."546

664

648

Being seated at the Father's right hand signifies the inaugu­

ration of the Messiah's kingdom, the fulfillment of the prophet

Daniel's vision concerning the Son of m an: "To him was given 541

dominion and glory and kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and

languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not

be destroyed." 54 7 After this event the apostles became witnesses of
the "kingdom [ that] will have no end . " 548

powers, even though they have been defeated definitively by
Christ's Passover. 558 Until everything is subject to him, " until there

imminent, 566 even though "it is not for you to know times or
seasons which the Father has fixed by his own authority." 567 This

673

1 040, 1 048

eschatological coming could be accomplished at any moment, even
if both it and the final trial that will precede it are "delayed ." 568

674

The glorious Messiah's coming is suspended at every mo­

ment of history until his recognition by " all Israel," for " a harden­
ing has come upon part of Israel" in their "unbelief" toward

Jesus . 569 St. Peter says to the Jews of Jerusalem after Pentecost:
"Repent therefore, and tum again, that your sins may be blotted
out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the
Lord, and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus,
whom heaven must receive until the time for establishing all that
God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old ."570 St.
Paul echoes him: "For if their rejection means the reconciliation of

840
58

the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the
dead?" 571 The "full inclusion" of the Jews in the Messiah's salva­
tion, in the wake of "the full number of the Gentiles," 572 will enable

the People of God to achieve "the measure of the stature of the

fullness of Christ," in which "God may be all in all." 573

The Church's ultimate trial

675

769

Before Christ's second coming the Church must pass

through a final trial that will shake the faith of many believers. 574
The persecution that accompanies her pilgrimage on earth575 will
unveil the "mystery of iniquity" in the form of a religious deception
offering men an apparent solution to their problems at the price of
apostasy from the truth. The supreme religious decep tion is that of
the Antichrist, a pseudo-messianism by which man glorifies him­

self in place of God and of his Messiah come in the flesh. 576

The Profession of Faith

676
The Antichrist's deception already begins to take shape in the
world every time the claim is made to realize within history that messianic
hope which can only be realized beyond history through the eschatalogical
judgment. The Church has rejected even modified forms of this falsifica­
tion of the kingdom to come under the name of millenarianism, 577 es ecially the "intrinsically perverse" political form of a secular messianism. 78

The Church will enter the glory of the kingdom only

through this final Passover, when she will follow her Lord in his
death and Resurrection. 579 The kingdom will be fulfilled, then, not

by a his toric triumph of the Church through a progressive ascen­

1340

dancy, but only by God's victory over the final unleashing of evil,

which will cause his Bride to come down from heaven. 580 God's

triumph over the revolt of evil will take the form of the Last
Judgment after the final cosmic upheaval of this passing world . 58l

To JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD

678

Following in the steps of the prophets and John the Bap tis t,

Jesus announced the judgment of the Last Day in his preaching.5 82

Then will the conduct of each one and the secrets of hearts be
brought to light. 583 Then will the culpable unbelief that counted
the offer of God's grace as nothing be condemned . 584 Our attitude

1470

about our neighbor will disclose accep tance or refusal of grace and

divine love. 58 5 On the last day Jesus will say: "Truly I say to you,
as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to

me." 586

679

Christ is Lord of eternal life. Full right to pass definitive

judgment on the works and hearts of men belongs to

him

as

redeemer of the world. He "acquired" this right by his cross. The
Father has given "all judgment to the Son."5 87 Yet the Son did not
come t o judge, but t o save and t o give the life h e has i n himse1f. 588

in this life, one already judges

oneself, receives

eternity by rejecting the Spirit of love .5 89

IN BRIEF
680

Christ the Lord already reigns through the Church, but
all the things of this world are not yet subjected to him.

The triumph of Christ's kingdom will not come about

without one last assault by the powers of evil.

681

On Judgment Day at the end of the world, Christ will

come in glory to achieve the definitive triumph of
good over evil which, like the wheat and the tares,

have grown up together in the course of history.

682

When he comes at the end of time to judge the living
and the dead, the glorious Christ will reveal the secret

disposition of hearts and will render to each man

according to his works and according to his acceptance
or refusal of grace.

C HAPTER THREE
B ELIEVE IN THE HoLY SPIRIT

683
"No one can say 'Jesus is Lord' except by the Holy Spirit." 1
"God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, 'Abba!
Father!"' 2 This knowledge of faith is possible only in the Holy 424, 2670
Spirit: to be in touch with Christ, we must first have been touched 152
by the Holy Spirit. He comes to meet us and kindles faith in us.
By virtue of our Baptism, the first sacrament of the faith, the
Holy Spirit in the Church communicates to us, intimately and
personally, the life that originates in the Father and is offered to
us in the Son.
Baptism gives us the grace of new birth in God the Father,
through his Son, in the Holy Spirit. For those who bear God's
Spirit are led to the Word, that is, to the Son, and the Son
presents them to the Father, and the Father confers incor­
ruptibility on them. And it is impossible to see God's Son
without the Spirit, and no one can approach the Father
without the Son, for the knowledge of the Father is the Son,
and the knowledge of God's Son is obtained through the
Holy Spirit. 3

249

Through his grace, the Holy Spirit is the first to awaken
684
faith in us and to communicate to us the new life, which is to "know
the Father and the one whom he has sent, Jesus Christ." 4 But the
Spirit is the last of the persons of the Holy Trinity to be revealed.
St. Gregory of Nazianzus, the Theologian, explains this progres236
sion in terms of the pedagogy of divine "condescension":
The Old Testament proclaimed the Father clearly, b u t the
Son more obscurely. The New Testament revealed the Son
and gave us a glimpse of the divinity of the Spirit. Now the
Spirit dwells among us and grants us a clearer vision of
himself. It was not prudent, when the divinity of the
Father had not yet been confessed, to proclaim the Son
op enly and, when the divinity of the Son was not yet
admitted, to add the Holy Spirit as an extra burden, to
speak somewhat daringly . . . . By advancing and progressing "from glory to glory," the light of the Trinity will shine
in ever more brilliant rays. S

Part One

685
To believe in the Holy Spirit is to profess that the Holy
Spirit is one of the persons of the Holy Trinity, consubstantial with
the Father and the Son: "with the Father and the Son he is wor­
shipped and glorified." 6 For this reason, the divine mystery of the
Holy Spirit was already treated in the context of Trinitarian "the236 ology." Here, however, we have to do with the Holy Spirit only in
the divine "economy."
686
The Holy Spirit is at work with the Father and the Son from
the beginning to the completion of the plan for our salvation. But
258 in these "end times," ushered in by the Son's redeeming Incarna­
tion, the Spirit is revealed and given, recognized and welcomed as
a person. Now can this divine plan, accomplished in Christ, the
firstborn and head of the new creation, be embodied in mankind
by the outpouring of the Spirit: as the Church, the communion of
saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the
life everlasting.
ARTICLE 8

"I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY SPIRIT"

687
"No one comprehends the thoughts of God except the
Spirit of God." 7 Now God's Spirit, who reveals God, makes known
243 to us Christ, his Word, his living Utterance, but the Spirit does not
speak of himself. The Spirit who "has spoken through the proph­
ets" makes us hear the Father's Word, but we do not hear the Spirit
himself. We know him only in the movement by which he reveals
the Word to us and disposes us to welcome him in faith. The Spirit
of truth who "unveils" Christ to us "will not speak on his own." 8
Such properly divine self-effacement explains why "the world
cannot receive [him], because it neither sees him nor knows him,"
while those who believe in Christ know the Spirit because he
dwells with them. 9
688
The Church, a communion living in the faith of the apos­
tles which she transmits, is the place where we know the Holy
Spirit:

- in the Church's Magisterium, which he assists;

which the Holy Spirit puts us into communion with Christ;
- in prayer, wherein he intercedes for us;
- in the charisms and ministries by which the Church is built up;
- in the signs of apostolic and missionary life;
- in the witness of saints through whom he manifests his holiness
and continues the work of salvation.

THE JOINT MISSION OF TilE SON AND TilE SPIRIT

689
The One whom the Father has sent into our hearts, the
Spirit of his Son, is truly God. 10 Consubstantial with the Father and
the Son, the Spirit is inseparable from them, in both the inner life 245
of the Trinity and his gift of love for the world. In adoring the Holy
Trinity, life-giving, consubstantial, and indivisible, the Church's
faith also professes the distinction of persons. When the Father
sends his Word, he always sends his Breath. In their joint mission, 254
the Son and the Holy Spirit are distinct but inseparable. To be sure, 485
it is Christ who is seen, the visible image of the invisible God, but
it is the Spirit who reveals him.
690
Jesus is Christ, "anointed," because the Spirit is his anointing, and everything that occurs from the Incarnation on derives
from this fullness. 11 When Christ is finally glorified,l 2 he can in 436
tum send the Spirit from his place with the Father to those who
believe in him: he communicates to them his glory,13 that is, the
Holy Spirit who glorifies him. 14 From that time on, this joint
mission will be manifested in the children adopted by the Father
in the Body of his Son: the mission of the Spirit of adoption is to 788
unite them to Christ and make them live in him:

10 Cf. Ga/ 4:6.
11 Cf. Jn 3:34.
12 Jn 7:39.

182

Part One
The notion of anointing suggests . . . tha t there is no distance
between the Son and the Spirit. Indeed, just as between the
surface of the body and the anointing with oil neither reason
nor sensation recognizes any intermediary, so the contact of
the Son with the Spirit is immediate, so that anyone who
would make contact with the Son by faith must first encoun­
ter the oil by contact. In fact there is no part that is not covered
by the Holy Spirit. That is why the confession of the Son's
Lordship is made in the Holy Spirit by those who receive
him, the Spirit coming from all sides to those who approach
the Son in faith. 15

448

II.

THE NAME, TITLES, AND SYMBOLS
OF THE HOLY SPIRIT

The proper name of the Holy Spirit

691
"Holy Spirit" is the proper name of the one whom we
adore and glorify with the Father and the Son. The Church has
received this name from the Lord and professes it in the Baptism
of her new children. 16
The term "Spirit" translates the Hebrew word ruah, which,
in its primary sense, means breath, air, wind . Jesus indeed
uses the sensory image of the wind to suggest to Nicodemus
the transcendent newness of him who is personally God's
breath, the divine Spirit. l 7 On the other hand, "Spirit" and
"Holy" are divine attributes common to the three divine
persons. By joining the two terms, Scripture, liturgy, and
theological language designate the inexpressible person of
the Holy Spirit, without any possible equivocation with
other uses of the terms "spirit" and "holy."

Titles of the Holy Spirit

692
When he proclaims and promises the coming of the Holy
Spirit, Jesus calls him the "Paraclete," literally, "he who is called to
1 433 one's side," ad-vocatus. l 8 "Paraclete" is commonly translated by
"consoler," and Jesus is the first consoler. 19 The Lord also called
the Holy Spirit "the Spirit of truth."20

16 Cf. Mt 28:19.
17 Jn 3 :5-8.
18 Jn 1 4 :16, 26; 15:26; 16:7.
19 Cf. 1 Jn 2:1.
20 Jn 16:13.

183

The Profession of Faith

Besides the proper name of "Holy Spirit," which is most
693
frequently used in the Acts of the Apostles and in the Epistles, we
also find in St. Paul the titles: the Spirit of the promise,21 the Spirit
of adoption, 22 the Spirit of Christ, 23 the Spirit of the Lord,24 and the
Spirit of God 25 - and, in St. Peter, the Spirit of glory 26
.

Symbols of the Holy Spirit

694
Water. The symbolism of water signifies the Holy Spirit's action
in Baptism, since after the invocation of the Holy Spirit it becomes the
efficacious sacramental sign of new birth: just as the gestation of our first
birth took place in water, so the water o f Baptism truly signifies that our
birth into the divine life is given to us in the Holy Spirit. As ''by one Spirit
we were all baptized," so we are also "made to drink of one Spirit.'' 27 Thus
the Spirit is also personally the living water welling up from Christ
crucified 28 as its source and welling up in us to eternal life !- 9
695
Anointing. The symbolism of anointing with oil also signifies the
Holy Spirit, 30 to the point of becoming a synonym for the Holy Spirit. In
Christian initiation, anointing is the sacramental sign of Confirmation,
called "chrismation" in the Churches of the East. Its full force can be
grasped only in relation to the primary anointing accomplished by the
Holy Spirit, that of Jesus. Christ (in Hebrew "messiah") means the one
"anointed" by God's Spirit. There were several anointed ones of the Lord
in the Old Covenant, pre-eminently King David. 31 But Jesus is God's
Anointed in a unique way: the humanity the Son assumed was entire
anointed by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit established him as "Christ. "
The Virgin Mary conceived Christ b y the Holy Spirit who, through the angel,
proclaimed him the Christ at his birth, and prompted Simeon to come to the
temple to see the Christ of the Lord. 33 The Spirit filled Christ and the power
of the Spirit went out from him in his acts of healing and of saving.34 Finally,
it was the Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead. 35 Now, fully established as
"Christ" in his humanity victorious over death, Jesus pours out the Holy Spirit
abundantly until "the saints" constitute - in their union with the humanity of
the Son of God - that perfect man "to the measure of the stature of the fullness
of Christ":36 "the whole Christ," in St. Augustine's expression.

Fire. While wa ter signifies bi rth and the fruitfulness of life given
in the Holy Spirit, fire symbolizes the transforming energy of the Holy
Spirit's actions. The prayer of the prophet Elijah, who "arose like fire" and
whose "word burned like a torch," brought down fire from heaven on the
sacrifice on Mount Carmei.37 This event was a "figure" of the fire of the
Holy Spirit, who transforms what he touches. John the Baptist, who goes
"before [the Lord] in the spirit and power of Elijah," proclaims Christ as
the one who "will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire." 38 Jesus
will say of the Spirit: "I came to cast fire upon the earth; and would that it
were already kindled! n 39 In the form of tongues "as of fire," the Holy Spirit
rests on the disciples on the morning of Pentecost and fills them with
himself. 40 The spiritual tradition has retained this symbolism of fire as one
of the most expressive images of the Holy Spirit's actions. 41 "Do not
quench the Spirit." 42
697

484
554

659

Cloud and light. These two images occur together in the manifes­
tations of the Holy Spirit. In the theophanies of the Old Testament, the
cloud, now obscure, now luminous, reveals the living and saving God,
while veiling the transcendence of his glory - with Moses on Mount
Sinai, 43 at the tent of meeting, 44 and during the wandering in the desert,45
and with Solomon at the dedication of the Temple. 46 In the Holy Spirit,
Christ fulfills these figures. The Spirit comes upon the Virgin Mary and
"overshadows" her, so that she might conceive and give birth to Jesus. 47
On the mountain of Transfiguration, the Spirit in the "cloud came and
overshadowed" Jesus, Moses and Elijah, Peter, James and John, and "a
voice came out of the cloud, saying, 'This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to
him ! ' " 48 Finally, the cloud took Jesus out of the sight of the disciples on
the day of his ascension and will reveal him as Son of man in glory on the
day of his final corning. 49

The seal is a symbol close to that of anointing. "The Father has set
his seal" on Christ and also seals us in him. 50 Because this seal indicates
the indelible effect of the anointing with the Holy Spirit in the sacraments
of Baptism, Confirmation, and Holy Orders, the image of the seal (sphragis)
has been used in some theological tradi tions to express the indelible
"character" imprinted b y these three unrepeatable sacraments.
699
The hand. Jesus heals the sick and blesses little children by laying
hands on them. 51 In his name the apostles will do the same. 52 Even more
pointedly, it is by the Apostles' imposition of hands that the Holy Sp irit is
given. 53 The Letter to the Hebrews lists the imposition of hands among the
"fundamental elements" of its teaching.54 The Church has kept this sign of
the all-powerful outpouring of the Holy Spirit in its sacramental epicleses.
700
The finger. "It is by the finger of God that Uesus] cast out demons." 55 If God's law was written on tablets of stone "by the finger of
God," then the "letter from Christ" entrusted to the care of the apostles, is
written "with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on
tablets of human hearts. "56 The hymn Veni Creator Spiritus invokes the
Holy Spirit as the "finger of the Father's right hand." 57

Bap tism, a dove released by Noah returns with a fresh olive-tree branch
in its beak as a sign that the earth was again habitable. 58 When Christ
comes up from the water of his baptism, the Holy Spirit, in the form o f a
dove, comes down upon him and remains with him. 59 The Spirit comes
down and remains in the purified hearts of the baptized. In certain
churches, the Eucharist is reserved in a metal receptacle in the form of a
dove (columbarium) suspended above the altar. Christian iconography
traditionally uses a dove to suggest the Spirit.

GOD'S SPIRIT AND WORD IN THE TIME OF THE PROMISES

702

From the beginning until "the fullness of time," 60 the joint

mission of the Father's Word and Spirit remains h idden, but it is at

122

work. God's Spirit prepares for the time of the Messiah. Neither is

fully revealed but both are already promised, to be watched for and

welcomed at their manifestation. So, for this reason, when the
Church reads the Old Testament, she searches there for what the

1 07

Spirit, "who has spoken through the prophets," wants to tell us
about Christ. 61

243

By "prophets" the faith of the Church here understands all whom
the Holy Spirit inspired in living proclamation and in the composition of
the sacred books, both of the Old and the New Testaments. Jewish tradi­
tion distinguishes first the Law (the five first books or Pentateuch), then
the Prophets (our historical and prophetic books) and finally the Writings
(especially the wisdom literature, in particular the Psalms).02

himself will assume that "image" 67 and restore it in the Father's

"likeness" by giving it again its Glory, the Spirit who is "the giver

of life . "

706

Against all human hope, G o d promises descendants to

Abraham, as the fruit of faith and of the power of the Holy Spirit . 68
In Abraham's progeny all the nations of the earth will be blessed.

This progeny will be Christ himselC 69 in whom the outpouring of

60

the Holy Spirit will "gather into one the children of God who are
scattered abroad . " 70 God commits himself by his own solemn oath
to giving his beloved Son and "the promised Holy Spirit . . . [who

is] the guarantee of our inheritance un til we acquire possession of

it." 71

In Theophanies and the Law

707

Theophanies (manifestations of God) light up the way of

the promise, from the patriarchs to Moses and from Joshua to the

visions that inaugurated the missions of the great prophets. Chris­
tian tradition has always recognized that God's Word allowed

himself to be seen and heard in these theophanies, in which the
cloud of the Holy Spirit both revealed him and concealed him in
its shadow .

708

This divine ped agogy appears especially in the gift of the

Law. 72 God gave the Law as a "pedagogue" to lead his people
towards Christ. 73 But the Law's powerlessness to save man de-

1 961-1 964

prived of the divine "likeness," along with the growing awareness 122
o f sin that i t imparts, 74 enkindles a desire for the Holy Spirit. The 2585
lamentations of the Psalms bear witness to this.

709

The Law, the sign of God's p romise and covenant, ought

to have governed the hearts and institutions of that people to 2579

a holy nation." 75 But after David ; Israel gave in to the temptation
of becoming a kingdom like other nations. The Kingdom, however,
the object of the promise made to David,76 would be the work of
the Holy Spirit; it would belong to the poor according to the Spirit.
710
The forgetting of the Law and the infidelity to the covenant
end in death: it is the Exile, apparently the failure of the promises,
which is in fact the mysterious fidelity of the Savior God and the
beginning of a promised restoration, but according to the Spirit.
The People of God had to suffer this purification. 77 In God's plan,
the Exile already stands in the shadow of the Cross, and the
Remnant of the poor that returns from the Exile is one of the most
transparent prefigurations of the Church.
Expectation of the Messiah and his Spirit
711
"Behold, I am doing a new thing." 78 Two prophetic lines
64 were to develop, one leading to the expectation of the Messiah, the
522 other pointing to the announcement of a new Spirit. They converge
in the small Remnant, the people of the poor, who await in hope
the "consolation of Israel" and "the redemption of Jerusalem." 79
We have seen earlier how Jesus fulfills the prophecies concerning
himself. We limit ourselves here to those in which the relationship of the
Messiah and his Spirit appears more clearly.

712
The characteristics of the awaited Messiah begin to appear
in the "Book of Emmanuel" ("Isaiah said this when he saw his
439 glory," 80 speaking of Christ), especially in the first two verses of
Isaiah 1 1 :
There shall come forth a shoot from the stump o f Jesse,
and a branch shall grow out of his roots.
And the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him,
the spirit of wisdom and understanding,
the spirit of counsel and might,
the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LoRo. 81

713
The Messiah's characteristics are revealed above all in the
"Servant songs." 82 These songs proclaim the meaning of Jesus' 601
Passion and show how he will pour out the Holy Spirit to give life
to the many: not as an outsider, but by embracing our "form as
slave." 83 Taking our death upon himself, he can communicate to
us his own Spirit of life.
714
This is why Christ inaugurates the proclamation of the
Good News by making his own the following passage from
Isaiah: 84
The Spirit of the LORD God is upon me,
because the LORD has anointed me
to bring good tidings to the afflicted;
he has sent me to bind up the broken hearted,
to proclaim liberty to the captives,
and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;
to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor.

The prophetic texts that directly concern the sending of the
715
Holy Spirit are oracles by which God speaks to the heart of his
people in the language of the promise, with the accents of "love
and fidelity." 85 St. Peter will proclaim their fulfillment on the 2 1 4
morning o f Pentecost. 86 According to these promises, at the "end
time" the Lord's Spirit will renew the hearts of men, engraving a
new law in them. He will gather and reconcile the scattered and
divided peoples; he will transform the first creation, and God will 1 965
dwell there with men in peace.

716
The People of the "poor" 87 - those who, humble and meek,
rely solely on their God's mysterious plans, who await the justice,
not of men but of the Messiah - are in the end the great achievement
of the Holy Spirit's hidden mission during the time of the promises
that prepare for Christ's coming. It is this quality of heart, purified
and enlightened by the Spirit, which is expressed in the Psalms. In
these poor, the Spirit is making ready "a people prepared for the 368
Lord." 88

THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST IN THE FULLNESS OF TIME

IV.

John, precursor, prophet, and baptist
"There was a man sent from God, whose name was

717

523

John." 89 John was "filled with the Holy Spirit even from his
mother's womb" 90 by Christ himself, whom the Virgin Mary had

just conceived by the Holy Spirit. Mary's visitation to Elizabeth
thus became a visit from God to his people. 9 1

John is "Elijah [who] must come." 92 The fire of the Spirit

718

dwells in him and makes him the forerunner of the coming Lord.

696 In John, the precursor, the Holy Spirit completes the work of
" [making] ready a people prepared for the Lord." 93

John the Baptist is "more than a prophet." 94

719

In

him, the

Holy Spirit concludes his speaking through the prophets. John
completes the cycle of prophets begun by Elijah. 95 He proclaims

2 684

the imminence of the consolation of Israel; he is the "voice" of the
Consoler who is coming. 9 6 As the Spirit of truth will also do, John
"came to bear witness to the light." 9 7 In John's sight, the Spirit thus

brings to completion the careful search of the prophets and fulfills
the longing of the angels. 9 8 "He on whom you see the Spirit
descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.
And

I

have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of

536 God . . . . Behold, the Lamb of God." 99

720

Finally, with John the Baptist, the Holy Spirit begins the

535 restoration to man of "the divine likeness," prefiguring what he
would achieve with and in Christ. John's baptism was for repen­

tance; baptism in water and the Spirit will be a new birth. 1 00

The Profession of Faith
"Rej oice, you who are full of grace"

721

Mary, the all-holy ever-virgin Mother of God, is the mas­

terwork of the mission of the Son and the Spirit in the fullness of
time. For the first time in the plan of salva tion and because his Spirit

had prepared her, the Father found the dwelling place where his Son
and his Spirit could dwell among men. In this sense the Church's

484

Tradition has often read the most beautiful texts on wisdom in
relation to Mary. 1 0 1 Mary is acclaimed and represented in the
liturgy as the "Seat of Wisdom."

In her,

the "wonders of God" that the Spirit was to fulfill

in Christ and the Church began to be manifested :

722

The Holy Spirit

prepared

Mary by his grace. It w a s fitting

that the mother of him in whom " the whole fullness of deity dwells
bodily" 1 02 should herself be " full of grace. " She was, by sheer grace,

489

conceived without sin as the most humble of creatures, the most

capable of welcoming the inexpressible gift of the Almighty. It was

quite correct for the angel Gabriel to greet her as the "Daughter of
Zion": "Rejoice . " 1 03 I t is the thanksgiving of the whole People of
God, and thus of the Church, which Mary in her canticle 1 04 lifts up

2676

to the Father in the Holy Spirit while carrying within her the eternal

Son.

723

In Mary, the Holy Spirit

fulfills

the plan of the Father's

loving goodness. Through the Holy Spirit the Virgin conceives and

gives birth to the Son of God. By the Holy Spirit's power and her
faith, her virginity became uniquely fruitful. 105

724

In Mary, the Holy Spirit

manifests

485
506

the Son of the Father,

now become the Son of the Virgin. She is the burning bush of the
definitive theophany. Filled with the Holy Spirit she makes the

Word visible

in the humility of his flesh . It is to the poor and the

963

first representatives of the gentiles that she makes him known. 1 06

725

Finally, through Mary, the Holy Spirit begins to bring men,

the objects of God's merciful love,1 07

in to communion

with Christ .

And the humble are always the first t o accep t him: shepherds,

disciples.

726
At the end of this mission of the Spirit, M ary became the
Woman, the new Eve ("mother of the living"), the mother of the
494, 2618 "whole Christ." 108 As such, she was present with the Twelve, who
"with one accord devoted themselves to prayer," 109 at the dawn of
the "end time" which the Spirit was to inaugurate on the morning
of Pentecost with the manifestation of the Church.
Christ Jesus

727
The entire mission of the Son and the Holy Spirit, in the
438, 695 fullness of time, is contained in this: that the Son is the one anointed
536 by the Father's Spirit since his Incarnation - Jesus is the Christ, the
Messiah.
Everything in the second chapter of the Creed is to be read
in this light. Christ's whole work is in fact a joint mission of the Son
and the Holy Spirit. Here, we shall mention only what has to do
with Jesus' promise of the Holy Spirit and the gift of him by the
glorified Lord.
728
Jesus does not reveal the Holy Spirit fully, until he himself
has been glorified through his Death and Resurrection. Neverthe­
less, little by little he alludes to him even in his teaching of the
multitudes, as when he reveals that his own flesh will be food for
the life of the world. 110 He also alludes to the Spirit in speaking to
Nicodernus,l 11 to the Samaritan wornan,l 12 and to those who take
part in the feast of Tabernacles. 113 To his disciples he speaks openly
of the Spirit in connection with prayer 114 and with the witness they
2615 will have to bear. 115
729
Only when the hour has arrived for his glorification does
Jesus promise the corning of the Holy Spirit, since his Death and
Resurrection will fulfill the promise made to the fathers. 116 The
Spirit of truth, the other Paraclete, will be given by the Father in
answer to Jesus' prayer; he will be sent by the Father in Jesus' name;

At last Jesus' hour arrives: 11 7 he commends his spirit into
the Father's hands 1 18 at the very moment when by his death he

730

conquers death, so that, "raised from the dead by the glory of the

Father," 119 he might immediately give the Holy Spirit by "breathing" on his disciples . 120 From this hour onward, the mission of
Christ and the Spirit becomes the mission of the Church: "As the
Father has sent me, even so I send you." 121

THE SPIRIT AND THE CHURCH IN THE LAST DAYS

Pentecost
731

On the day of Pentecos t when the seven weeks of Easter

had come to an end, Christ's Passover is fulfilled in the outpouring
of the Holy Spirit, manifested, given, and communicated as a

2623, 767

divine person: of his fullness, Christ, the Lord, pours out the Spirit
in abundance.l 22

1302

732

On that day, the Holy Trinity is fully revealed. Since that

day, the Kingdom announced by Christ has been open to those who
believe in him: in the humility of the flesh and in faith, they already

244

never ceases, the Holy Spirit causes the world to enter into the "last

672

share in the communion of the Holy Trinity. By his coming, which
days," the time of the Church, the Kingdom already inherited
though not yet consummated .

We have seen the true Light, we have received the heavenly
Spirit, we have found the true faith: we adore the indivisible
Trinity, who has saved us. 123

Part One

The Holy Spirit - God's gift
733
"God is Love" 124 and love is his first gift, containing all
2 1 8 others. "God's love has been poured into our hearts through the
Holy Spirit who has been given to us." 125
734
Because we are dead or at least wounded through sin, the
1 987 first effect of the gift of love is the forgiveness of our sins. The
communion of the Holy Spirit 126 in the Church restores to the
baptized the divine likeness lost through sin.
735
He, then, gives us the "pledge" or "first fruits" of our
1 822 inheritance: the very life of the Holy Trinity, which is to love as
"God [has] loved us." 127 This love (the "charity" of 1 Cor 13) is the
source of the new life in Christ, made possible because we have
received "power" from the Holy Spirit. 128
736
By this power of the Spirit, God's children can bear much
1 832 fruit. He who has grafted us onto the true vine will make us bear
"the fruit of the Spirit: . . . love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control." 129 "We live by the
Spirit"; the more we renounce ourselves, the more we "walk by the
Spirit. u130
Through the Holy Spirit we are restored to paradise, led back
to the Kingdom of heaven, and adopted as children, given
confidence to call God "Father" and to share in Christ's
grace, called children of light and given a share in eternal
l31
glory.

The Holy Spirit and the Church
737
The mission of Christ and the Holy Spirit is brought to
completion in the Church, which is the Body of Christ and the
787-798 Temple of the Holy Spirit. This joint mission henceforth brings
Christ's faithful to share in his communion with the Father in the
1 093-1 1 09 Holy Spirit. The Spirit prepares men and goes out to them with his
grace, in order to draw them to Christ. The Spirit manifests the risen
Lord to them, recalls his word to them and opens their minds to

the understanding of his Death and Resurrection. He makes present
the mystery of Christ, supremely in the Eucharist, in order to
reconcile them, to bring them into communion with God, that they
may "bear much fruit." 1 32

738
Thus the Church's mission is not an addition to that of
Christ and the Holy Spirit, but is its sacrament: in her whole being
and in all her members, the Church is sent to announce, bear 850, 777
witness, make present, and spread the mystery of the communion
of the Holy Trinity (the topic of the next article):
All of us who have received one and the same Spirit, that is , the
Holy Spirit, are in a sense blended together with one another
and with God. For if Christ, together with the Father's and his
own Spirit, comes to dwell in each of us, though we are many,
still the Spirit is one and undivided. He binds together the spirits
of each and every one of us, . . . and makes all appear as one
in him. For just as the power of Christ's sacred flesh unites
those in whom it dwells into one body, I think that in the
same way the one and undivided Spirit of God, who dwells
T3
in all, leads all into spiritual unity_ 3

739
Because the Holy Spirit is the anointing of Christ, it is
Christ who, as the head of the Body, pours out the Spirit among his
members to nourish, heal, and organize them in their mutual 1 076
functions, to give them life, send them to bear witness, and associate them to his self-offering to the Father and to his intercession for
the whole world. Through the Church's sacraments, Christ com­
municates his Holy and sanctifying Spirit to the members of his
Body. (This will be the topic of Part Two of the Catechism.)
740
These "mighty works of God," offered to believers in the
sacraments of the Church, bear their fruit in the new life in Christ,
according to the Spirit. (This will be the topic of Part Three.)
741
"The Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know
how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes with
sighs too deep for words. " 134 The Holy Spirit, the artisan of God's
works, is the master of prayer. (This will be the topic of Part Four.)

"Because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his

743

From the beginning to the end of time, whenever God
sends his Son, he always sends his Spirit: their mission
is conjoined and inseparable.

744

In the fullness of time the Holy Spirit completes in
Mary all the preparations for Christ's coming among
the People of God. By the action of the Holy Spirit in
her, the Father gives the world Emmanuel, "God­
with-us" (Mt 1:23).

745

The Son of God was consecrated as Christ (Messiah)
by the anointing of the Holy Spirit at his Incarnation
(cf. Ps 2:6-7).

746

By his Death and his Resurrection, Jesus is constituted
in glory as Lord and Christ (cf. Acts 2:36). From his
fullness, he poured out the Holy Spirit on the apostles
and the Church.

The Holy Spirit, whom Christ the head pours out on
his members, builds, animates, and sanctifies the
Church. She is the sacrament of the Holy Trinity's

ARTICLE 9

"I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH"

748
"Christ is the light of humanity; and it is, accordingly, the
heart-felt desire of this sacred Council, being gathered together in
the Holy Spirit, that, by proclaiming his Gospel to every creature,
it may bring to all men that light of Christ which shines out visibly
from the Church." 135 These words open the Second Vatican Coun­
cil's Dogmatic Constitution on the Church. By choosing this starting
point, the Council demonstrates that the article of faith about the
Church depends entirely on the articles concerning Christ Jesus.
The Church has no other light than Christ's; according to a favorite
image of the Church Fathers, the Church is like the moon, all its
light reflected from the sun.
749
The article concerning the Church also depends entirely
on the article about the Holy Spirit, which immediately precedes
it. "Indeed, having shown that the Spirit is the source and giver of
all holiness, we now confess that it is he who has endowed the
Church with holiness." 136 The Church is, in a phrase used by the
Fathers, the place "where the Spirit flourishes." 137
750
To believe that the Church is "holy" and "catholic," and
that she is "one" and "apostolic" (as the Nicene Creed adds), is
inseparable from belief in God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy 8 1 1
Spirit. In the Apostles' Creed we profess " one Holy Church" (Credo
. . . Ecclesiam), and not to believe in the Church, so as not to confuse
God with his works and to attribute clearly to God's goodness all 1 69
the gifts he has bestowed on his Church. 138

NAMES AND IMAGES O F THE CHURCH

751
The word "Church" (Latin ecclesia, from the Greek ek-ka­
lein, to "call out of") means a convocation or an assembly. It
designates the assemblies of the people, usually for a religious
purpose.l 39 Ekklesia is used frequently in the Greek Old Testament
for the assembly of the Chosen People before God, above all for
135 LG 1; cf. Mk 16:15.

their assembly on Mount Sinai where Israel received the Law and
was established by God as his holy people. 140 By calling itself
"Church," the first community of Christian believers recognized
itself as heir to that assembly. In the Church, God is "calling
together" his people from all the ends of the earth. The equivalent
Greek term Kyriake, from which the English word Church and the
German Kirche are derived, means "what belongs to the Lord."

752
In Christian usage, the word "church" designates the litur­
gical assembly, 141 but also the local community142 or the whole
1 1 40, 832 universal community of believers.l 43 These three meanings are
830 inseparable. "The Church" is the People that God gathers in the
whole world. She exists in local communities and is made real as
a liturgical, above all a Eucharistic, assembly. She draws her life
from the word and the Body of Christ and so herself becomes
Christ's Body.
Symbols of the Church

753
In Scripture, we find a host of interrelated images and
figures through which Revelation speaks of the inexhaustible mys­
tery of the Church. The images taken from the Old Testament are
variations on a profound theme: the People of God. In the New
781 , 789 Testament, all these images find a new center because Christ has
become the head of this people, which henceforth is his Body. 144
Around this center are grouped images taken "from the life of the
shepherd or from cultivation of the land, from the art of building
or from family life and marriage."l 45

857 754

"The Church is, accordingly, a sheepfold, the sole and necessary
gateway to which is Christ. It is also the flock of which God himself foretold
that he would be the shepherd, and whose sheep, even though governed
by human shepherds, are unfailingly nourished and led by Christ himself,
the Good Shepherd and Prince of Shepherds, who gave his life for his
sheep. 146

"The Church is a cultivated field, the tillage of God. On that land
the ancient olive tree grows whose holy roots were the prophets and in
which the reconciliation of Jews and Gentiles has been brought about and
will be brought about again. That land, like a choice vineyard, has been
planted by the heavenly cultivator. Yet the true vine is Christ who gives
life and fruitfulness to the branches, that is, to us, who through the Church
remain in Christ, without whom we can do nothing. 147
756
"Often, too, the Church is called the building of God. The Lord
compared himself to the stone which the builders rejected, but which was
made into the corner-stone. On this foundation the Church is built by the
apostles and from it the Church receives solidity and unity. This edifice
has many names to describe it: the house of God in which hisfamily dwells;
the household of God in the Spirit; the dwelling-place of God among men;
and, especially, the holy temple. This temple, symbolized in places of
worship built out of stone, is praised by the Fathers and, not without
reason, is compared in the liturgy to the Holy City, the New Jerusalem. As
living stones we here on earth are built into it. It is this holy city that is seen
by John as it comes down out of heaven from God when the world is made
anew, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband. 148
757
"The Church, further, which is called 'that Jerusalem which is
above' and 'our mother', is described as the spotless spouse of the spotless
lamb. It is she whom Christ 'loved and for whom he delivered himself up
that he might sanctify her.' It is she whom he unites to himself by an
unbreakable alliance, and whom he constantly 'nourishes and cherishes. "'149

THE CH URCH ' S ORIGIN, FOUNDATION, AND MISSION

We begin our investigation of the Church's mystery by 257
meditating on her origin in the Holy Trinity's plan and her pro­
gressive realization in history.
A plan born in the Father's heart
759
"The eternal Father, in accordance with the utterly gratui­
tous and mysterious design of his wisdom and goodness, created
the whole universe and chose to raise up men to share in his own 293
divine life," 15° to which he calls all men in his Son. "The Father . . .
determined to call together in a holy Church those who should
believe in Christ." 151 This "family of God" is gradually formed and 1 655
takes shape during the stages of human history, in keeping with
the Father's plan. In fact, "already present in figure at the beginning

of the world, this Church was prepared in marvellous fashion in the
history of the people of Israel and the old Alliance. Established in this
last age of the world and made manifest in the outpouring of the Spirit,
it will be brought to glorious completion at the end of time." 152
The Church - foreshadowed from the world's beginning

760
Christians of the first centuries said, "The world was cre­
ated for the sake of the Church." 153 God created the world for the
sake of communion with his divine life, a communion brought
294 about by the "convocation" of men in Christ, and this "convoca­
tion" is the Church. The Church is the goal of all things,154 and God
permitted such painful upheavals as the angels' fall and man's sin
309 only as occasions and means for displaying all the power of his arm
and the whole measure of the love he wanted to give the world:
Just as God's will is creation and is called "the world," so his
intention is the salvation of men, and it is called "the Church."155

The Church - prepared for in the Old Covenant

761
The gathering together of the People of God began at the
moment when sin destroyed the communion of men with God, and
that of men among themselves. The gathering together of the Church
55 is, as it were, God's reaction to the chaos provoked by sin. This
reunification is achieved secretly in the heart of all peoples: "In every
nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable" to
God. 156
762
The remote preparation for this gathering together of the
People of God begins when he calls Abraham and promises that
1 22, 522 he will become the father of a great people. 157 Its immediate
60 preparation begins with Israel's election as the People of God. By
this election, Israel is to be the sign of the future gathering of all
nations. 158 But the prophets accuse Israel of breaking the covenant
64 and behaving like a prostitute. They announce a new and eternal
covenant. "Christ instituted this New Covenant." 159

The Church - instituted by Christ Jesus

763
It was the Son's task to accomplish the Father's plan of
salvation in the fullness of time. Its accomplishment was the reason
for his being sent. 160 "The Lord Jesus inaugurated his Church by
preaching the Good News, that is, the coming of the Reign of God,
promised over the ages in the scriptures." 161 To fulfill the Father's 541
will, Christ ushered in the Kingdom of heaven on earth. The
Church "is the Reign of Christ already present in mystery." 162
764
"This Kingdom shines out before men in the word, in the
works and in the presence of Christ." 163 To welcome Jesus' word
is to welcome "the Kingdom itsel£." 164 The seed and beginning of 543
the Kingdom are the "little flock" of those whom Jesus came to
gather around him, the flock whose shepherd he is. 165 They form
Jesus' true family. 166 To those whom he thus gathered around him, 1 691
2558
he taught a new "way of acting" and a prayer of their own. 167
765
The Lord Jesus endowed his community with a structure
that will remain until the Kingdom is fully achieved. Before all else
there is the choice of the Twelve with Peter as their head. 168
Representing the twelve tribes of Israel, they are the foundation 610
stones of the new Jerusalem. 169 The Twelve and the other disciples 551
share in Christ's mission and his power, but also in his lot. 170 By
all his actions, Christ prepares and builds his Church.
766
The Church is born primarily of Christ's total self-giving
for our salvation, anticipated in the institution of the Eucharist and
fulfilled on the cross. "The origin and growth of the Church are
symbolized by the blood and water which flowed from the open
side of the crucified Jesus." 171 "For it was from the side of Christ
as he slept the sleep of death upon the cross that there came forth
the 'wondrous sacrament of the whole Church. "tl 72 As Eve was

formed from the sleeping Adam's side, so the Church was born
from the pierced heart of Christ hanging dead on the cross. 1 73
The Church - revealed by the Holy Spirit

767
"When the work which the Father gave the Son to do on
earth was accomplished, the Holy Spirit was sent on the day of
73 1 Pentecost in order that he might continually sanctify the
Church." 1 74 Then "the Church was openly displayed to the crowds
and the spread of the Gospel among the nations, through preach­
ing, was begun." 1 75 As the "convocation" of all men for salvation,
849 the Church in her very nature is missionary, sent by Christ to all
the nations to make disciples of them. 176
768
So that she can fulfill her mission, the Holy Spirit "bestows
upon [the Church] varied hierarchic and charismatic gifts, and in
this way directs her." 177 "Henceforward the Church, endowed with
the gifts of her founder and faithfully observing his precepts of
charity, humility and self-denial, receives the mission of proclaiming
and establishing among all peoples the Kingdom of Christ and of God,
541 and she is on earth the seed and the beginning of that kingdom." 178
The Church - perfected in glory

769
"The Church . . . will receive its perfection only in the glory
of heaven," 179 at the time of Christ's glorious return. Until that day,
671, 2818 "the Church progresses on her pilgrimage amidst this world's
persecutions and God's consolations." 180 Here below she knows
that she is in exile far from the Lord, and longs for the full coming
675 of the Kingdom, when she will "be united in glory with her
king." 181 The Church, and through her the world, will not be
perfected in glory without great trials. Only then will "all the just
from the time of Adam, 'from Abel, the just one, to the last of the elect,'
1 045 . . . be gathered together in the universal Church in the Father's
presence." 182

THE MYSTERY OF THE CHURCH

770

The Church is in history, but at the same time she tran­

scends it. It is only "with the eyes of faith" 183 that one can see her

in her visible reality and at the same time in her spiritual reality as 812

bearer of divine life.

The Church - both visible and sp iritual

771

"The one mediator, Christ, established and ever sustains

here on earth his holy Church, the community of faith, hope, and

827

charity, as a visible organization through which he communicates

truth and grace to all men." 184 The Church is at the same time:

- a "s ociety structured with hierarchical organs and the mystical

body of Christ;

1 880

- the visible society and the spiritual community;
- the earthly Church and the Church endowed with heavenly
riches." 185
These dimensions together constitute "one complex real-

ity which comes together from a human and a divine element" : 186
The Church is essentially both human and divine, visible but
endowed with invisible realities, zealous in action and dedi­
cated to contemplation, present in the world, but as a pil­
grim, so constituted that in her the human is directed toward
and subordinated to the divine, the visible to the invisible,
action to contemplation, and this present world to that city
yet to come, the object of our quest. 187

0 humility! 0 sublimity! Both tabernacle of cedar and sanc­
tuary of God; earthly dwelling and celestial palace; house of
clay and royal hall; body of death and temple of light; and
at last both object of scorn to the proud and bride of Christ!
She is black but beautiful, 0 daughters of Jerusalem, for even
if the labor and pain of her long exile may have discolored
1
her, yet heaven's beauty has adorned her . 88

The Church - mystery of man's union with God

51 8 772
It is in the Church that Christ fulfills and reveals his own
796 mystery as the purpose of God's plan: "to unite all things in
him . " 189 St. Paul calls the nuptial rmion of Christ and the Church

"a great mystery. " Because she is rmited to Christ as to her bride­

groom, she becomes a mystery in her tum. 1 90 Contemplating this
mystery in her, Paul exclaims: "Christ in you, the hope of glory.'' 1 9 1

773

In

the Church this commrmion of men with God, in the

"love [that] never ends," is the purpose which governs everything
in her that is a sacramental means, tied to this passing world.l 92

" [The Church's] structure is totally ordered to the holiness of

671
972

Christ's members. And holiness is measured according to the

'great mystery' in which the Bride responds with the gift of love to
the gift of the Bridegroom. " 1 93 Mary goes before us all in the

holiness that is the Church's mystery as "the bride without spot or
wrinkle." 1 94 This is why the "Marian" dimension of the Church
precedes the "Petrine." 1 95

The universal Sacrament of Salvation
The Greek word mysterion was translated into Latin by two terms:
mysterium and sacramentum. In later usage the term sacramentum emphasizes the visible sign of the hidden reality of salvation which was indicated
by the term mysterium. In this sense, Christ himself is the mystery of
salvation: "For there is no other mystery of God, except Christ. " 196 The
saving work of his holy and sanctifying humanity is the sacrament of
salvation, which is revealed and active in the Church's sacraments (which
the Eastern Churches also call "the holy mysteries"). The seven sacraments
are the signs and instruments by which the Holy Spirit spreads the grace of
Christ the head throughout the Church which is his Body. The Church, then,
both contains and communicates the invisible grace she signifies. It is in this
analogical sense, that the Church is called a "sacrament."

the inner union of men with God. Because men's communion with
one another is rooted in that union with God, the Church is also
the sacrament of the unity of the human race. In her, this unity is already
begun, since she gathers men "from every nation, from all tribes and 360
peoples and tongues";198 at the same time, the Church is the "sign and
instrument" of the full realization of the unity yet to come.

776
As sacrament. the Church is Christ's instrument. "She is
taken up by him also as the instrument for the salvation of all," "the
universal sacrament of salvation/' by which Christ is "at once 1 088
manifesting and actualizing the mystery of God's love for men. " 199
The Church "is the visible plan of God's love for humanity,"
because God desires "that the whole human race may become one
People of God, form one Body of Christ, and be built up into one
temple of the Holy Spirit. "200

IN BRIEF
777

The word "Church" means "convocation. " It desig­
nates the assembly of those whom God's Word "con­
vokes," i.e., gathers together to form the People of
God, and who themselves, nourished with the Body
of Christ, become the Body of Christ.

778

The Church is both the means and the goal of God's
plan: prefigured in creation, prepared for in the Old
Covenant, founded by the words and actions of Jesus
Christ, fulfilled by his redeeming cross and his Resur­
rection, the Church has been manifested as the mys­
tery of salvation by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
She will be perfected in the glory of heaven as the
assembly of all the redeemed of the earth (cf. Rev 14:4).

779

The Church is both visible and spiritual, a hierarchical
society and the Mystical Body of Christ. She is one, yet
formed of two components, human and divine. That
is her mystery, which only faith can accept.

780

The Church in this world is the sacrament of salvation,
the sign and the instrument of the communion of God
and men.

781
At all times and in every race, anyone who fears God and
does what is right has been acceptable to him. He has, however,
willed to make men holy and save them, not as individuals without
any bond or link between them, but rather to make them into a
people who might acknowledge him and serve him in holiness. He
therefore chose the Israelite race to be his own people and estab­
lished a covenant with it. He gradually instructed this people . . . .
All these things, however, happened as a preparation for and
figure of that new and perfect covenant which was to be ratified in
Christ . . . the New Covenant in his blood; he called together a race
made up of Jews and Gentiles which would be one, not according
to the flesh, but in the Spirit.u 201
Characteristics of the People of God

The People of God is marked by characteristics that clearly
distinguish it from all other religious, ethnic, political, or cultural
groups found in history:

871 782

2 787 - It is the People of God: God is not the property of any one people.

But he acquired a people for himself from those who previously
were not a people: 11a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy
nation." 202

1267 - One becomes a member of this people not by a physical birth, but

by being "born anew," a birth "of water and the Spirit," 203 that is,
by faith in Christ, and Baptism.

695 - This People has for its Head Jesus the Christ (the anointed, the

Messiah). Because the same anointing, the Holy Spirit, flows from
the head into the body, this is "the messianic people."

1 741 - liThe status of this people is that of the dignity and freedom of the

sons of God, in whose hearts the Holy Spirit dwells as in a temple. ��

Jesus Christ is the one whom the Father anointed with the

the responsibilities for mission and service that flow from them. 2 08

one receives a share in this people's unique,

priestly

vocation:

1 546

to be a spiritual house and a holy priesthood."209

"The holy People of God shares also in Christ's

785

prophetic

office," above all in the supernatural sense of faith that belongs to
the whole People, lay and clergy, when it "unfailingly adheres to

this faith . . . once for all delivered to the saints," 21 0 and when it

92

deepens its understanding and becomes Christ's witness in the

midst of this world.

Finally, the People of God shares in the

786

royal

office of

Christ. He exercises his kingship by drawing all men to himself
through his death and Resurrection. 211 Christ, King and Lord of
the universe, made himself the servant of all, for he came "not to

be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." 212

For the Christian, "to reign is to serve him," particularly when

serving "the poor and the suffering, in whom the Church recog-

of God fulfills its royal dignity by a life in keeping with its vocation
2443 to serve with Christ.
The sign of the cross makes kings of all those reborn in Christ
and the anointing of the Holy Spirit consecrates them as
priests, so that, apart from the particular service of our
ministry, all spiritual and rational Christians are recognized
as members of this royal race and sharers in Christ's priestly
office. What, indeed, is as royal for a soul as to govern the
body in obedience to God? And what is as priestly as to
dedicate a pure conscience to the Lord and to offer the
spotless offerings of devotion on the altar of the heart? 214

II.

THE CHURCH - B ODY OF CHRIST

The Church is communion with Jesus

787
From the beginning, Jesus associated his disciples with his
own life, revealed the mystery of the Kingdom to them, and gave
them a share in his mission, joy, and sufferings. 215 Jesus spoke of
a still more intimate communion between him and those who
would follow him: "Abide in me, and I in you . . . I am the vine,
755 you are the branches." 216 And he proclaimed a mysterious and real
communion between his own body and ours: "He who eats my
flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him." 217
.

788
When his visible presence was taken from them, Jesus did
not leave his disciples orphans. He promised to remain with them
until the end of time; he sent them his Spirit. 218 As a result com690 munion with Jesus has become, in a way, more intense: "By com­
municating his Spirit, Christ mystically constitutes as his body
those brothers of his who are called together from every nation."219
789
The comparison of the Church with the body casts light on
the intimate bond between Christ and his Church. Not only is she
52 1 gathered around him; she is united in him, in his body. Three aspects
of the Church as the Body of Christ are to be more specifically
noted: the unity of all her members with each other as a result of
their union with Christ; Christ as head of the Body; and the Church

"One Body"

790
Believers who respond to God's word and become members of Christ's Body, become intimately united with him: "In that
body the life of Christ is communicated to those who believe, and 947
who, through the sacraments, are united in a hidden and real way
to Christ in his Passion and glorification. " 220 This is especially true
of Baptism, which unites us to Christ's death and Resurrection, and 1227
the Eucharist, by which "really sharing in the body of the Lord, . . . we 1 329
are taken up into communion with him and with one another." 22 1
791
The body's unity does not do away with the diversity of
its members: "In the building up of Christ's Body there is engaged
a diversity of members and functions. There is only one Spirit who, 814
according to his own richness and the needs of the ministries, gives 1 937
his different gifts for the welfare of the Church." 222 The unity of
the Mystical Body produces and stimulates charity among the
faithful: "From this it follows that if one member suffers anything,
all the members suffer with him, and if one member is honored, all
the members together rejoice."223 Finally, the unity of the Mystical
Body triumphs over all human divisions: "For as many of you as
were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew
nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor
female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. "224
"Christ is the Head of this Body"

792
Christ "is the head of the body, the Church." 225 He is the 669
principle of creation and redemption. Raised to the Father's glory, 1 1 1 9
" in everything he [is] preeminent," 226 especially in the Church,
through whom he extends his reign over all things.
793
Christ unites us with his Passover: all his members must 661
strive to resemble him, "until Christ be formed" in them. 227 "For 519
this reason we . . . are taken up into the mysteries of his life, . . .

Christ and his Church thus together make up the "whole

(Christus totus).

The Church is one with Christ. The saints

695 are acutely aware of this unity:

Let us rejoice then and give thanks that we have become not
only Christians, but Christ himself. Do you understand and
grasp, brethren, God's grace toward us? Marvel and rejoice:
we have become Christ. For if he is the head, we are the
members; he and we together are the whole man . . . . The
fullness of Christ then is the head and the members. But what
does "head and members" mean? Christ and the Church. 230

�

Our redeemer has shown himself to be one erson with the
holy Church whom he has taken to himself. 31

1474

Head and members form as it were one and the same mys­
2 2
tical person. 3
A reply of St. Joan of Arc to her judges sums up the faith of
the holy doctors and the good sense of the believer: "About
Jesus Christ and the Church, I simply know they:'re just one
2
thing, and we shouldn't complicate the matter." 33

The Church is the Bride of Christ

796

The unity of Christ and the Church, head and members of

one Body, also implies the distinction of the two within a personal

relationship. This aspect is often expressed by the image of bride-

757
219
772

groom and bride. The theme of Christ as Bridegroom of the Church

was prepared for by the prophets and announced by John the
Baptist. 234 The Lord referred to himself as the "bridegroom." 235

The Apostle speaks of the whole Church and of each of the faithful,
members of his Body, as a bride "betrothed" to Christ the Lord so

as to become but one spirit with him . 236 The Church is the spotless

himself up for her, that he might sanctify her." 238 He has joined her
with himself in an everlasting covenant and never stops caring for 1 61 6
her as for his own body: 239
This is the whole Christ, head and body, one formed from
many . . . whether the head or members speak, it is Christ
who speaks. He speaks in his role as the head (ex persona
capitis) and in his role as body (ex persona corporis) . What does
this mean? "The two will become one flesh. This is a great
mystery, and I am applying it to Christ and the Church. '' 240

And the Lord himself sa:xs in the Gospel: "So they are no
longer two, but one flesh.''241 They are, in fact, two different
persons, yet they are one in the conjugal union, . . . as head,

he calls himself the bridegroom, as body, he calls himself
"bride. "242
III.

THE CHURCH IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT

797
"What the soul is to the human body, the Holy Spirit is to
the Body of Christ, which is the Church." 243 "To this Spirit of
Christ, as an invisible principle, is to be ascribed the fact that all the 813
parts of the body are joined one with the other and with their
exalted head; for the whole Spirit of Christ is in the head, the whole
Spirit is in the body, and the whole Spirit is in each of the mem­
bers."244 The Holy Spirit makes the Church "the temple of the
586
living God": 245
Indeed, it is to the Church herself that the "Gift of God" has
been entrusted . . . . In it is in her that communion with Christ
has been deposited, that is to say: the Holy Spirit, the pledge
of incorruptibility, the strengthening of our faith and the
ladder of our ascent to God . . . . For where the Church is,
there also is God's Spirit where God's Spirit is, there is the
Church and every grace. 46

The Holy Spirit is "the principle of every vital and truly
saving action in each part of the Body." 247 He works in many ways
737 to build up the whole Body in charity: 248 by God's Word "which
is able to build you up";249 by Baptism, through which he forms
1 091-1 1 09 Christ's Body;250 by the sacraments, which give growth and heal­
ing to Christ's members; by "the grace of the apostles, which holds
first place among his gifts";25 1 by the virtues, which make us act
according to what is good; finally, by the many special graces
(called "charisms"), by which he makes the faithful "fit and ready
791 to undertake various tasks and offices for the renewal and building
up of the Church."252
Charisms

799
Whether extraordinary or simple and humble, charisms
are graces of the Holy Spirit which directly or indirectly benefit the
951 , 2003 Church, ordered as they are to her building up, to the good of men,
and to the needs of the world.
800
Charisms are to be accepted with gratitude by the person
who receives them and by all members of the Church as well. They
are a wonderfully rich grace for the apostolic vitality and for the
holiness of the entire Body of Christ, provided they really are
genuine gifts of the Holy Spirit and are used in full conformity with
authentic promptings of this same Spirit, that is, in keeping with
charity, the true measure of all charisms. 253
801
It is in this sense that discernment of charisms is always
necessary. No charism is exempt from being referred and submit894 ted to the Church's shepherds. "Their office [is] not indeed to
extinguish the Spirit, but to test all things and hold fast to what is
good," 254 so that all the diverse and complementary charisms work
1 905 together "for the conunon good." 255

The Profession of Faith

213

IN BRIEF
802

Christ Jesus " gave himself for us to redeem us from all
iniquity and to purify for himself a people of his own"
(Titus 2:14).

803

"You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy
nation, God's own people" (1 Pet 2:9).

804

One enters into the People of God by faith and Bap­
tism. "All men are called to belong to the new People
of God" (LG 13), so that, in Christ, "men may form one
family and one People of God" (AG 1).

805

The Church is the Body of Christ. Through the Spirit and
his action in the sacraments, above all the Eucharist,
Christ, who once was dead and is now risen, establishes
the community of believers as his own Body.

806

In the unity of this Body, there is a diversity of mem­
bers and functions. All members are linked to one
another, especially to those who are suffering, to the
poor and persecuted.

807

The Church is this Body of which Christ is the head:
she lives from him, in him, and for him; he lives with
her and in her.

808

The Church is the Bride of Christ: he loved her and
handed himself over for her. He has purified her by
his blood and made her the fruitful mother of all God's
children.

809

The Church is the Temple of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit
is the soul, as it were, of the Mystical Body, the source
of its life, of its unity in diversity, and of the riches of
its gifts and charisms.

810

"Hence the universal Church is seen to be 'a people
brought into unity from the unity of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit"' (LG 4 citing St. Cyprian, De
Dam. orat. 23: PL 4, 553).

Paragraph 3. The Church Is One, Holy, Catholic,
and Apostolic

811
"This is the sole Church of Christ, which in the Creed we
profess to be one, holy, catholic and apostolic."256 These four
750 characteristics, inseparably linked with each other,257 indicate es­
sential features of the Church and her mission. The Church does
832, 865 not possess them of herself; it is Christ who, through the Holy
Spirit, makes his Church one, holy, catholic, and apostolic, and it
is he who calls her to realize each of these qualities.
812
Only faith can recognize that the Church possesses these
properties from her divine source. But their historical manifesta1 56, 770 tions are signs that also speak clearly to human reason. As the First
Vatican Council noted, the "Church herself, with her marvellous
propagation, eminent holiness, and inexhaustible fruitfulness in
everything good, her catholic unity and invincible stability, is a
great and perpetual motive of credibility and an irrefutable witness
of her divine mission."258

"The sacred mystery of the Church's unity" (UR 2)

813
The Church is one because ofher source: "the highest exemplar
and source of this mystery is the unity, in the Trinity of Persons, of
1 72 one God, the Father and the Son in the Holy Spirit." 259 The Church
766 is one because of her founder: for "the Word made flesh, the prince of
peace, reconciled all men to God by the cross, . . . restoring the unity
797 of all in one people and one body." 260 The Church is one because of
her "soul": "It is the Holy Spirit, dwelling in those who believe and
pervading and ruling over the entire Church, who brings about
that wonderful communion of the faithful and joins them together
so intimately in Christ that he is the principle of the Church's
unity." 26 l Unity is of the essence of the Church:
What an astonishing mystery! There is one Father of the
universe, one Logos of the universe, and also one Holy Spirit,

everywhere one and the same; there is also one virgin be­
'
come mother, and I should like to call her "Church .' 262

From the beginning, this one Church has been marked by
814
a great diversity which comes from both the variety of God's gifts
and the diversity of those who receive them. Within the nnity of 791 , 873
the People of God, a multiplicity of peoples and cultures is gath­
ered together. Among the Church's members, there are different
gifts, offices, conditions, and ways of life. "Holding a rightful place 1 202
in the commnnion of the Church there are also particular Churches
that retain their own traditions." 263 The great richness of such
diversity is not opposed to the Church's unity. Yet sin and the 832
burden of its consequences constantly threaten the gift of nnity.
And so the Apostle has to exhort Christians to "maintain the nnity
of the Spirit in the bond of peace." 264

815
What are these bonds of unity? Above all, charity "binds 1 827
everything together in perfect harrnony." 265 But the unity of the 830, 837
1 73
pilgrim Church is also assured by visible bonds of commnnion:
- profession of one faith received from the Apostles;
- common celebration of divine worship, especially of the sacraments;
- apostolic succession through the sacrament of Holy Orders,
maintaining the fraternal concord of God's family. 266

816
"The sole Church of Christ [is that] which our Savior, after
his Resurrection, entrusted to Peter's pastoral care, commissioning
him and the other apostles to extend and rule it. . . . This Church,
constituted and organized as a society in the present world, sub­
sists in (subsistit in) the Catholic Church, which is governed by the
successor of Peter and by the bishops in commnnion with him."267
The Second Vatican Council's Decree on Ecumenism explains:
"For it is through Christ's Catholic Church alone, which is
the universal help toward salvation, that the fullness of the
means of salvation can be obtained. It was to the apostolic
college alone, of which Peter is the head, that we believe that
our Lord entrusted all the blessings of the New Covenant, in
order to establish on earth the one Body of Christ into which
all those should be fully incorporated who belong in any way
to the People of God .'''2 68

Wounds to unity

817
In fact, "in this one and only Church of God from its very
beginnings there arose certain rifts, which the Apostle strongly
censures as damnable. But in subsequent centuries much more
serious dissensions appeared and large communities became sepa­
rated from full communion with the Catholic Church - for which,
often enough, men of both sides were to blame." 269 The ruptures
that wound the unity of Christ's Body - here we must distinguish
2089 heresy, apostasy, and schism 270 - do not occur without human sin:
Where there are sins, there are also divisions, schisms, here­
sies, and d isputes. Where there is virtue, however, there also
are harmony and unity, from which arise the one heart and
one soul of all believers . 271

"However, one cannot charge with the sin of the separa­
818
tion those who at present are born into these communities [that
resulted from such separation] and in them are brought up in the
faith of Christ, and the Catholic Church accepts them with respect
and affection as brothers . . . . All who have been justified by faith
1 2 71 in Baptism are incorporated into Christ; they therefore have a right
to be called Christians, and with good reason are accepted as
brothers in the Lord by the children of the Catholic Church." 272

819
"Furthermore, many elements of sanctification and of
truth" 273 are found outside the visible confines of the Catholic
Church: "the written Word of God; the life of grace; faith, hope,
and charity, with the other interior gifts of the Holy Spirit, as well
as visible elements." 274 Christ's Spirit uses these Churches and
ecclesial communities as means of salvation, whose power derives
from the fullness of grace and truth that Christ has entrusted to the
Catholic Church. All these blessings come from Christ and lead to
him,275 and are in themselves calls to "Catholic unity. "276

Toward unity

820
"Christ bestowed unity on his Church from the beginning.
This unity, we believe, subsists in the Catholic Church as some­
thing she can never lose, and we hope that it will continue to
increase until the end of time." 277 Christ always gives his Church
the gift of unity, but the Church must always pray and work to
maintain, reinforce, and perfect the unity that Christ wills for her.
This is why Jesus himself prayed at the hour of his Passion, and 2 748
does not cease praying to his Father, for the unity of his disciples:
"That they may all be one. As you, Father, are in me and I am in
you, may they also be one in us, . . . so that the world may know
that you have sent me. "278 The desire to recover the unity of all
Christians is a gift of Christ and a call of the Holy Spirit. 279
821

call:

Certain things are required in order to respond adequately to this

- a permanent renewal of the Church in greater fidelity to her vocation;
such renewal is the driving-force of the movement toward unity;280

- conversion of heart as the faithful "try to live holier lives according to the 827
Gospel";281 for it is the unfaithfulness of the members to Christ's gift which
causes divisions;

- prayer in common, because "change of heart and holiness of life, along 2 791
with public and private prayer for the unity o f Christians, should be
regarded as the soul of the whole ecumenical movement, and merits the
name 'spiritual ecumenism; "'282

-fraternal knowledge of each other;283
- ecumenical formation of the faithful and especially of priests;284
- dialogue among theologians and meetings among Christians of the different churches and communities;285

- collaboration among Christians in various areas of service to mankind.286

Concern for achieving unity "involves the whole Church,

THE CHURCH Is HotY

823
"The Church . . . is held, as a matter of faith, to be unfail­
ingly holy. This is because Christ, the Son of God, who with the
459 Father and the Spirit is hailed as 'alone holy,' loved the Church as
796 his Bride, giving himself up for her so as to sanctify her; he joined
her to himself as his body and endowed her with the gift of the
Holy Spirit for the glory of God." 289 The Church, then, is "the holy
946 People of God,"290 and her members are called "saints. " 291
824
United with Christ, the Church is sanctified by him;
through him and with him she becomes sanctifying. "All the
activities of the Church are directed, as toward their end, to the
sanctification of men in Christ and the glorification of God."292 It
is in the Church that "the fullness of the means of salvation"293 has
81 6 been deposited. It is in her that "by the grace of God we acquire
holiness." 294
825
"The Church on earth is endowed already with a sanctity
that is real though imperfect." 295 In her members perfect holiness
670 is something yet to be acquired: "Strengthened by so many and
such great means of salvation, all the faithful, whatever their
2013 condition or state - though each in his own way - are called by the
Lord to that perfection of sanctity by which the Father himself is
perfect. " 296

If the Church w a s a body composed o f different members, i t
could n't lack the noblest o f all; it must have a Heart, and a
Heart BURNING WITH LOVE. And I realized that this love
alone was the true motive force which enabled the other
members of the Church to act; if it ceased to function, the
Apostles would forget to preach the gospel, the Martyrs
would refuse to shed their blood. LOVE, IN FACT, IS THE
VOCATION WHICH INCLUDES ALL OTHERS; IT'S A
UNIVERSE OF ITS OWN.( COMPRISING ALL TIME AND
SPACE - IT'S ETERNAL!L98

864

"Christ, 'holy, innocent, and undefiled,' knew nothing of
827
sin, but came only to expiate the sins of the people. The Church,
however, clasping sinn ers to her bosom, at once holy and always 1425-1429
in need of purification, follows constantly the path of penance and 82 1
renewal." 299 All members of the Church, including her ministers,
must acknowledge that they are sinn e rs. 300 In everyone, the weeds
of sin will still be mixed with the good wheat of the Gospel until
the end of time. 30 1 Hence the Church gathers sinners already
caught up in Christ's salvation but still on the way to holiness:
The Church is therefore holy, though having sinners in her
midst, because she herself has no other life but the life of
grace. If they live her life, her members are sanctified; if they
move away from her life, they fall into sins and disorders
that prevent the radiation of her sanctity. This is why she
suffers and does penance for those offenses, of which she has
the power to free her children through the blood of Christ
and the gift of the Holy Spirit . 302

By canonizing some of the faithful, i.e., by solerrmly pro­
828
claiming that they practiced heroic virtue and lived in fidelity to
God's grace, the Church recognizes the power of the Spirit of 1 1 73
holiness within her and sustains the hope of believers by proposing
the saints to them as models and intercessors. 303 "The saints have
always been the source and origin of renewal in the most difficult
moments in the Church's history." 304 Indeed, "holiness is the 2045
hidden source and infallible measure of her apostolic activity and
missionary zeal." 305

What does "catholic" mean?
830
The word "catholic" means "universal," in the sense of
" according to the totality" or "in keeping with the whole." The
Church is catholic in a double sense:

First, the Church is catholic because Christ is present in
795 her. "Where there is Christ Jesus, there is the Catholic Church."307
815-81 6 In her subsists the fullness of Christ's body united with its head;
this implies that she receives from him "the fullness of the means
of salvation"308 which he has willed: correct and complete confes­
sion of faith, full sacramental life, and ordained ministry in apos­
tolic succession. The Church was, in this fundamental sense,
catholic on the day of Pentecost309 and will always be so until the
day of the Parousia.
831
Secondly, the Church is catholic because she has been sent
849 out by Christ on a mission to the whole of the human race: 310
All men a r e called t o belong t o the new People o f God. This
People, therefore, while remaining one and only one, is to be
spread throughout the whole world and to all ages in order
that the design of God's will may be fulfilled: he made
human nature one in the beginning and has decreed that all
his children who were scattered should be finally gathered
together as one . . . . The character of universality which
adorns the People of God is a gift from the Lord himself
whereby the Catholic Church ceaselessly and efficaciously
seeks for the return of all humanity and all its goods, under
Christ the Head in the unity of his Spirit. 311

The Profession of Faith

221

Each particular Church is "catholic"
832

"The Church of Christ is really present in all legitimately

organized local groups of the faithful, which, in so far as they are

united to their pastors, are also quite appropriately called Churches

814
811

in the New Testament . . . . In them the faithful are gathered together

through the preaching of the Gospel of Christ, and the mystery of
the Lord's Supper is celebrated . . . . In these communities, though

they may often be small and poor, or existing in the diaspora, Christ

is present, through whose power and influence the One, Holy,
Catholic, and Apostolic Church is constituted." 31 2

833

The phrase "particular church," which is firs t of all the

diocese (or eparchy), refers to a community of the Christian faithful

in communion of faith and sacraments with their bishop ordained
in apostolic succession. 3 13 These particular Churches "are constituted after the model of the universal Church; it is in these and

886

formed out of them that the one and unique Catholic Church
exis ts." 31 4

834

Particular Churches are fully catholic through their com-

munion with one of them, the Church of Rome "which presides in
charity. "315 "For with this church, by reason of its pre-eminence,

the whole Church, that is the faithful everywhere, must necessarily
be in accord . "316 Indeed, "from the incarnate Word's descent to us,

882, 1369

all Christian churches everywhere have held and hold the great

Church that is here [at Rome] to be their only basis and foundation

since, according to the Savior's promise, the gates of hell have never
prevailed against her."317

835
"Let us be very careful not to conceive of the universal Church
as the simple sum, or . . . the more or less anomalous federation of
essentially different particular churches. In the mind of the Lord the
Church is universal by vocation and mission, but when she puts down her
roots in a variety of cultural, social, and human terrains, she takes on
different external expressions and appearances in each part of the
world."31 8 The rich variety of ecclesiastical disciplines, liturgical rites, and
theological and spiritual heritages proper to the local churches "unified in
a common effort, shows all the more resplendently the catholicity of the
3
undivided Church. " 19

Part One

Who belongs to the Cathol ic Church?
All men are called to this catholic unity of the People of
836
God . . . . And to it, in different ways, belong or are ordered: the
83 1 Catholic faithful, others who believe in Christ, and finally all
mankind, called by God's grace to salvation.u320
IJ

��Fully incorporated into the society of the Church are
837
those who, possessing the Spirit of Christ, accept all the means of
771 salvation given to the Church together with her entire organiza815 tion, and who - by the bonds constituted by the profession of faith,
the sacraments, ecclesiastical government, and communion - are
joined in the visible structure of the Church of Christ, who rules
her through the Supreme Pontiff and the bishops. Even though
incorporated into the Church, one who does not however perse882 vere in charity is not saved. He remains indeed in the bosom of the
Church, but 'in body' not 'in heart. "' 321
838
"The Church knows that she is joined in many ways to the
baptized who are honored by the name of Christian, but do not
818 profess the Catholic faith in its entirety or have not preserved unity
or conununion under the successor of Peter."322 Those "who be­
lieve in Christ and have been properly baptized are put in a certain,
1 2 71 although imperfect, conununion with the Catholic Church."323
With the Orthodox Churches, this conununion is so profound uthat
it lacks little to attain the fullness that would permit a common
1399 celebration of the Lord's Eucharist." 324
The Church and non-Christians
856 839
"Those who have not yet received the Gospel are related
to the People of God in various ways."325

The relationship of the Church with the Jewish People. When
she delves into her own mystery, the Church, the People of God in
the New Covenant, discovers her link with the Jewish People,326
63 11the first to hear the Word of God." 327 The Jewish faith, unlike
147 other non-Christian religions, is already a response to God's reve319 LG 23.

lation in the Old Covenant. To the Jews "belong the sonship, the
glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the
promises; to them belong the patriarchs, and of their race, accord­
ing to the flesh, is the Christ";328 "for the gifts and the call of God
are irrevocable."329

840
And when one considers the future, God's People of the Old
Covenant and the new People of God tend towards similar goals: expec­
tation of the coming (or the return) of the Messiah. But one awaits the
return of the Messiah who died and rose from the dead and is recognized
as Lord and Son of God; the other awaits the coming of a Messiah, whose
features remain hidden till the end of time; and the latter waiting is
accompanied by the drama of not knowing or of misunderstanding Christ
Jesus.

841
The Church's relationship with the Muslims. "The plan of
salvation also includes those who acknowledge the Creator, in the
first place amongst whom are the Muslims; these profess to hold
the faith of Abraham, and together with us they adore the one,
merciful God, mankind's judge on the last day. "330
842
The Church 's bond with non-Christian religions is in the first
place the common origin and end of the human race:
360
All nations form but one community. This is so because all
stem from the one stock which God created to people the
entire earth, and also because all share a common destiny,
namely God. His providence, evident goodness, and saving
designs extend to all against the day when the elect are
gathered together in the holy city
331
. . . .

843
The Catholic Church recognizes in other religions that
search, among shadows and images, for the God who is unknown yet
near since he gives life and breath and all things and wants all men to 28
be saved. Thus, the Church considers all goodness and truth found in 856
these religions as " a preparation for the Gospel and given by him who
enlightens all men that they may at length have life."332

844
In their religious behavior, however, men also display the
29
limits and errors that disfigure the image of God in them:
Very often, deceived by the Evil One, men have become vain
in their reasonings, and have exchanged the truth of God for
a lie, and served the creature rather than the Creator. Or else,

living and dying in this world without God, they are exposed

.

To rermite all his children, scattered and led astray by sin,
845
the Father willed to call the whole of humanity together into his
30 Son's Church. The Church is the place where humanity must
953 rediscover its rmity and salvation. The Church is "the world recon­
ciled." She is that bark which "in the full sail of the Lord's cross, by
the breath of the Holy Spirit, navigates safely in this world."
1219 According to another image dear to the Church Fathers, she is
prefigured by Noah's ark, which alone saves from the flood. 334
"Outside the Church there is no salvation"

846
How are we to understand this affirmation, often repeated
by the Church Fathers? 335 Re-formulated positively, it means that
all salvation comes from Christ the Head through the Church
which is his Body:

161, 1257

Basing itself on Scrip ture and Tradition, the Council teaches
that the Church, a pilgrim now on earth, is necessary for
salvation: the one Christ is the mediator and the way of
salvation; he is present to us in his body which is the Church.
He himself explicitly asserted the necessity of faith and
Bap tism, and thereby affirmed at the same time the necessity
of the Church which men enter through Baptism as through
a door. Hence they could not be saved who, knowing that
the Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God
through Christ, would refuse either to enter it or to remain
36
in it.3

847
This affirmation is not aimed at those who, through no
fault of their own, do not know Christ and his Church:
Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the
Gospel of Christ or his Church, but who nevertheless seek
God with a sincere heart, and, moved by grace, try in their
actions to do his will as they know it through the dictates of
their conscience - those too may achieve eternal salvation.337

848
"Although in ways known to himself God can lead those
who, through no fault of their own, are ignorant of the Gospel, to
1 260 that faith without which it is impossible to please him, the Church

still has the obligation and also the sacred right to evangelize all
men." 338
Mission - a requiremen t of the Church's catholicity

849
The missionary mandate. "Having been divinely sent to the
nations that she might be 'the universal sacrament of salvation,'
the Church, in obedience to the command of her founder and 738, 767
because it is demanded by her own essential universality, strives
to preach the Gospel to all men": 339 "Go therefore and make
disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all
that I have commanded you; and Lo, I am with you always, until
the close of the age." 340
850
The origin and purpose of mission. The Lord's missionary
mandate is ultimately grounded in the eternal love of the Most
Holy Trinity: "The Church on earth is by her nature missionary 257
since, according to the plan of the Father, she has as her origin the
mission of the Son and the Holy Spirit. "341 The ultimate purpose 730
of mission is none other than to make men share in the communion
between the Father and the Son in their Spirit of love. 342
851
Missionary motivation. It is from God's love for all men that
the Church in every age receives both the obligation and the vigor
of her missionary dynamism, "for the love of Christ urges us
on. "343 Indeed, God "desires all men to be saved and to come to
the knowledge of the truth";344 that is, God wills the salvation of
everyone through the knowledge of the truth. Salvation is found
in the truth. Those who obey the prompting of the Spirit of truth
are already on the way of salvation. But the Church, to whom this
truth has been entrusted, must go out to meet their desire, so as to
bring them the truth. Because she believes in God's universal plan
of salvation, the Church must be missionary.

continues and, in the course of history, unfolds the mission of
Christ, who was sent to evangelize the poor; so the Church, urged
on by the Spirit of Christ, must walk the road Christ himself
walked, a way of poverty and obedience, of service and self-sacri­
fice even to death, a death from which he emerged victorious by
his resurrection." 346 So it is that "the blood of martyrs is the seed
of Christians. " 347

1 428
2443

853
On her pilgrimage, the Church has also experienced the "discrep­
ancy existing between the message she proclaims and the human weak­
ness of those to whom the Gospel has been entrusted." 348 Only by taking
the "way of penance and renewal," the "narrow way of the cross," can the
People of God extend Christ's reign. 349 For "just as Christ carried out the
work of redemption in poverty and oppression, so the Church is called to
follow the same path if she is to communicate the fruits of salvation to
men. "350
854
By her very mission, "the Church . . . travels the same journey as
all humanity and shares the same earthly lot with the world: she is to be a
leaven and, as it were, the soul of human socie in its renewal by Christ
and transformation into the family of God." 51 Missionary endeavor
requires patience. It begins with the proclamation of the Gospel to peoples
and groups who do not yet believe in Christ,352 continues with the
establishment of Christian communities that are "a sign of God's_presence
in the world," 353 and leads to the foundation of local churches. 3 5'1 It must
involve a process of inculturation if the Gospel is to take flesh in each
people's culture. 355 There will be times of defeat. "With regard to indi­
viduals, groups, and peoples it is only by degrees that [the Church] touches
and penetrates them, and so receives them into a fullness which is Catho­
lic."356

The Church's mission stimulates efforts towards Christian
unity.357 Indeed, "divisions among Christians prevent the Church from
realizing in practice the fullness of catholicity proper to her in those of her
sons who, though joined to her by Baptism, are yet separated from full
communion with her. Furthermore, the Church herself finds it more
difficult to express in actual life her full catholicity in all its aspects. "358

The missionary task implies a respectful dialogue with those who
do not yet accept the Gospel. 359 Believers can profit from this dialogue by
learning to appreciate better "those elements of truth and grace which are
found among peoples, and which are, as it were, a secret presence of
God." 360 They proclaim the Good News to those who do not know it, in
order to consolidate, complete, and raise up the truth and the goodness
that God has distributed among men and nations, and to purify them from
error and evil "for the glory of God, the confusion of the demon, and the
happiness of man.'' 361

THE CHURCH Is APOSTOLIC

857
The Church is apostolic because she is founded on the 75
apostles, in three ways:
- she was and remains built on "the foundation of the Apostles,"362
the witnesses chosen and sent on mission by Christ himself;363
- with the help of the Spirit dwelling in her, the Church keeps and 1 71
hands on the teaching,364 the "good deposit," the salutary words
she has heard from the apostles;365
- she continues to be taught, sanctified, and guided by the apostles
until Christ's return, through their successors in pastoral office: the
college of bishops, "assisted by priests, in union with the successor 880
1 575
of Peter, the Church's supreme pastor":366
You are the eternal Shepherd
who never leaves his flock untended.
Through the apostles
you watch over us and protect us always.
You made them shepherds of the flock
to share in the work of your Son . . . . 367

The Apostles' mission

858
Jesus is the Father's Emissary. From the beginning of his
ministry, he "called to him those whom he desired; . . . . And he
appointed twelve, whom also he named apostles, to be with him, 551
and to be sent out to preach." 368 From then on, they would also be

his "emissaries" (Greek apostoloi). In them, Christ continues his
own mission: "As the Father has sent me, even so I send you." 369
425, 1 086 The apostles' ministry is the continuation of his mission; Jesus said
to the Twelve: "he who receives you receives me." 370

859
Jesus unites them to the mission he received from the
Father. As "the Son can do nothing of his own accord," but receives
everything from the Father who sent him, so those whom Jesus
sends can do nothing apart from him,371 from whom they received
both the mandate for their mission and the power to carry it out.
Christ's apostles knew that they were called by God as "ministers
876 of a new covenant," "servants of God," "ambassadors for Christ,"
"servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God." 372
860
In the office of the apostles there is one aspect that cannot
be transmitted: to be the chosen witnesses of the Lord's Resurrec­
tion and so the foundation stones of the Church. But their office
also has a permanent aspect. Christ promised to remain with them
642 always. The divine mission entrusted by Jesus to them "will con­
tinue to the end of time, since the Gospel they handed on is the
765 lasting source of all life for the Church. Therefore, . . . the apostles
1 087 took care to appoint successors. "373
The bishops - successors of the apostles

861
"In order that the mission entrusted to them might be
continued after their death, [the apostles] consigned, by will and
77 testament, as it were, to their immediate collaborators the duty of
completing and consolidating the work they had begun, urging
them to tend to the whole flock, in which the Holy Spirit had
appointed them to shepherd the Church of God. They accordingly
1 087 designated such men and then made the ruling that likewise on
their death other proven men should take over their ministry." 374

"Just as the office which the Lord confided to Peter alone,
as first of the apostles, destined to be transmitted to his successors,
is a permanent one, so also endures the office, which the apostles 880
received, of shepherding the Church, a charge destined to be
exercised without interruption by the sacred order of bishops."375 1556
Hence the Church teaches that "the bishops have by divine insti­
tution taken the place of the apostles as pastors of the Church, in
such wise that whoever listens to them is listening to Christ and
whoever despises them despises Christ and him who sent
Christ. " 376
The apostolate

863
The whole Church is apostolic, in that she remains,
through the successors of St. Peter and the other apostles, in
communion of faith and life with her origin: and in that she is "sent 900
out" into the whole world. All members of the Church share in this
mission, though in various ways. "The Christian vocation is, of its
nature, a vocation to the apostolate as well." Indeed, we call an 2472
apostolate "every activity of the Mystical Body" that aims "to
spread the Kingdom of Christ over all the earth." 377
864
"Christ, sent by the Father, is the source of the Church's
whole apostolate"; thus the fruitfulness of apostolate for ordained
ministers as well as for lay people clearly depends on their vital 828
union with Christ. 378 In keeping with their vocations, the demands
of the times and the various gifts of the Holy Spirit, the apostolate
assumes the most varied forms. But charity, drawn from the Eucha- 824
rist above all, is always "as it were, the soul of the whole aposto- 1 324
late."379
865
The Church is ultimately one, holy, catholic, and apostolic in
her deepest and ultimate identity, because it is in her that "the
Kingdom of heaven," the "Reign of God," 380 already exists and will 81 1 , 541
be fulfilled at the end of time. The kingdom has come in the person
of Christ and grows mysteriously in the hearts of those incorporated into him, until its full eschatological manifestation. Then all
those he has redeemed and made "holy and blameless before him
in love,"38 1 will be gathered together as the one People of God, the

IN BRIEF
866

The Church is one: she acknowledges one Lord, con­
fesses one faith, is born of one Baptism, forms only one
Body, is given life by the one Spirit, for the sake of one
hope (cf. Eph 4:3-5), at whose fulfillment all divisions
will be overcome.

867

The Church is holy: the Most Holy God is her author;
Christ, her bridegroom, gave himself up to make her
holy; the Spirit of holiness gives her life. Since she still
includes sinners, she is "the sinless one made up of
sinners." Her holiness shines in the saints; in Mary she
is already all-holy.

868

The Church is catholic: she proclaims the fullness of
the faith. She bears in herself and administers the
totality of the means of salvation. She is sent out to all
peoples. She speaks to all men. She encompasses all
times. She is "missionary of her very nature" (AG 2).

869

The Church is apostolic. She is built on a lasting foun­
dation: "the twelve apostles of the Lamb" (Rev 21:14).
She is indestructible (d. Mt 16:18). She is upheld infal­
libly in the truth: Christ governs her through Peter and
the other apostles, who are present in their successors,
the Pope and the college of bishops.

870

"The sole Church of Christ which in the Creed we
profess to be one, holy, catholic, and apostolic, . . .
subsists in the Catholic Church, which is governed by
the successor of Peter and by the bishops in commun­
ion with him. Nevertheless, many elements of sancti­
fication and of truth are found outside its visible
confines"(LG 8).

constituted as the people of God; for this reason, since they have 1268-1269
become sharers in Christ's priestly, prophetic, and royal office in
their own manner, they are called to exercise the mission which 782-786
God has entrusted to the Church to fulfill in the world, in accord
with the condition proper to each one. "385
872
"In virtue of their rebirth in Christ there exists among all
the Christian faithful a true equality with regard to dignity and the
activity whereby all cooperate in the building up of the Body of 1 934
Christ in accord with each one's own condition and function." 386 794
873
The very differences which the Lord has willed to put
between the members of his body serve its unity and mission. For
"in the Church there is diversity of ministry but unity of mission. 814, 1 937
To the apostles and their successors Christ has entrusted the office
of teaching, sanctifying, and governing in his name and by his
power. But the laity are made to share in the priestly, prophetical,
and kingly office of Christ; they have therefore, in the Church and
in the world, their own assignment in the mission of the whole
People of God." 387 Finally, "from both groups [hierarchy and laity]
there exist Christian faithful who are consecrated to God in their
own special manner and serve the salvific mission of the Church
through the profession of the evangelical counsels." 388

THE HIERARCHICAL CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH

Why the ecclesial ministry ?
874
Christ is himself the source of ministry in the Church. He
instituted the Church. He gave her authority and mission, orienta- 1 544
tion and goal:
In order to shepherd the People of God and to increase its
numbers without cease, Christ the Lord set up in his Church
a variety of offices which aim at the good of the whole body.
The holders of office, who are invested with a sacred power,

"How are they to believe in him of whom they have never

heard? And how are they to hear without a preacher? And how can
men preach unless they are sent?"390 No one - no individual and no
community - can proclaim the Gospel to himself: " Faith comes from

what is heard ."39 1 No one can give himself the mandate and the

mission to proclaim the Gospel. The one sent by the Lord does not
speak and act on his own authority, but by virtue of Christ's authority;

not as a member of the community, but speaking to it in the name of

Christ. No one can bestow gra(.e on himself; it must be given and
offered. This fact presupposes ministers of grace, authorized and

empowered by Christ. From him, bishops and priests receive the

1548 mission and faculty ("the sacred power") to act in persona Christi
1536 Capitis; deacons receive the strength to serve the people of God in the
diaconia of liturgy, word, and charity, in communion with the bishop
and his presbyterate. The minis try in which Christ's emissaries do and

give by God's grace what they canno t do and give by their own
powers, is called a "sacrament" by the Church's tradition. Indeed, the

ministry of the Church is conferred by a special sacrament.

876

Intrinsically linked to the sacramental nature of ecclesial

ministry is

1551

its ch a racte r as serv ice .

Entirely dependent on Christ

who gives mission and authority, ministers are truly "slaves of
Christ,"3 9 2 in the image of him who freely took " the form of a slave"

for us. 3 93 Because the word and grace of which they are ministers

427

are not their own, but are given to them by Christ for the sake of

others, they must freely become the slaves of ali. 394

877
Likewise, it belongs to the sacramental nature of ecclesial
ministry that it have a collegial character. In fact, from the beginning of
1559 his ministry, the Lord Jesus instituted the Twelve as "the seeds of the
new Israel and the beginning of the sacred hierarchy. "395 Chosen

together, they were also sent out together, and their fraternal unity

would be at the service of the fraternal communion of all the faithful:

they would reflect and witness to the communion of the divine

persons .39 6 For this reason every bishop exercises his ministry from

Finally, it belongs to the sacramental nature of ecclesial min­

personal character.

Although Christ's ministers act

in communion with one another, they also always act in a personal
way. Each one is called personally: "You, follow me"397 in order to be

a personal witness within the common mission, to bear personal
responsibility before him who gives the mission, acting "in his per-

son" and for other persons: "I baptize you in the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit . . . "; "I absolve you . . . . "

Sacramental ministry in the Church, then, is a service

exercised in the name of Christ. It has a personal character and a

collegial form. This is evidenced by the bonds between the episco­

pal college and its head, the successor of St. Peter, and in the
relationship between the bishop's pastoral responsibility for his

particular church and the common solicitude of the episcopal

college for the universal Church.

The episcopal college and its head, the Pope

880

When Chris t instituted the Twelve, "he cons tituted [them]

in the form of a college or permanent assembly, at the head of which
he placed Peter, chosen from among them . "39 8 Jus t as "by the
Lord's ins titution, St. Peter and the rest of the apostles constitute a

552, 862

single apostolic college, so in like fashion the Roman Pontiff, Peter's

successor, and the bishops, the successors of the apostles, are
related with and united to one another."3 99

881

The Lord made Simon alone, whom he named Peter, the

"rock" of his Church. He gave him the keys of his Church and
instituted him shepherd of the whole flock. 4 00 "The office of bind-

Peter and the other apostles belongs to the Church's very founda-

Part One

882
The Pope, Bishop of Rome and Peter's successor, "is the
perpetual and visible source and foundation of the unity both of
834, 1 369 the bishops and of the whole company of the faithful."402 "For the
837 Roman Pontiff, by reason of his office as Vicar of Christ, and as
pastor of the entire Church has full, supreme, and universal power
over the whole Church, a power which he can always exercise
unhindered." 403
883
"The college or body ofbishops has no authority unless united
with the Roman Pontiff, Peter's successor, as its head." As such,
this college has "supreme and full authority over the universal
Church; but this power cannot be exercised without the agreement
of the Roman Pontiff." 404
884
"The college of bishops exercises power over the universal
Church in a solemn manner in an ecumenical council." 405 But
"there never is an ecumenical council which is not confirmed or at
least recognized as such by Peter's successor." 40 6
885
"This college, in so far as it is composed of many members,
is the expression of the variety and universality of the People of
God; and of the unity of the flock of Christ, in so far as it is
assembled under one head." 407
886
"The individual bishops are the visible source and founda­
tion of unity in their own particular Churches." 408 As such, they
1560, 833 "exercise their pastoral office over the portion of the People of God
assigned to them,"409 assisted by priests and deacons. But, as a
member of the episcopal college, each bishop shares in the concern
for all the Churches. 41 0 The bishops exercise this care first "by
ruling well their own Churches as portions of the universal
Church," and so contributing "to the welfare of the whole Mystical
Body, which, from another point of view, is a corporate body of
Churches." 41 1 They extend it especially to the poor,412 to those
2448 persecuted for the faith, as well as to missionaries who are working
throughout the world.

Neighboring particular Churches who share the same cul­
ture form ecclesiastical provinces or larger groupings called patriar­
chates or regions. 4l 3 The bishops of these groupings can meet in
synods or provincial councils. "In a like fashion, the episcopal confer­
ences at the present time are in a position to contribute in many and
fruitful ways to the concrete realization of the collegiate spirit." 41 4
The teaching office

85-87,
2032-2040

888
Bishops, with priests as co-workers, have as their first task
"to preach the Gospel of God to all men," in keeping with the
Lord's cornrnand. 415 They are "heralds of faith, who draw new 2068
disciples to Christ; they are authentic teachers" of the apostolic
faith "endowed with the authority of Christ."4 1 6
889
In order to preserve the Church in the purity of the faith
handed on by the apostles, Christ who is the Truth willed to confer
on her a share in his own infallibility. By a "supernatural sense of 92
faith" the People of God, under the guidance of the Church's living
Magisteriurn, "unfailingly adheres to this faith." 4 1 7
890
The mission of the Magisterium is linked to the definitive
nature of the covenant established by God with his people in
Christ. It is this Magisteriurn's task to preserve God's people from
deviations and defections and to guarantee them the objective 851
possibility of professing the true faith without error. Thus, the
pastoral duty of the Magisterium is aimed at seeing to it that the
People of God abides in the truth that liberates. To fulfill this
service, Christ endowed the Church's shepherds with the charism
of infallibility in matters of faith and morals. The exercise of this 1 785
charism takes several forms:
891
"The Roman Pontiff, head of the college of bishops, enjoys
this infallibility in virtue of his office, when, as supreme pastor and
teacher of all the faithful - who confirms his brethren in the faith ­
he proclaims by a definitive act a doctrine pertaining to faith or
morals . . . . The infallibility promised to the Church is also present
in the body of bishops when, together with Peter's successor, they
exercise the supreme Magisteriurn," above all in an Ecumenical
Counci1. 418 When the Church through its supreme Magisteriurn

proposes a doctrine "for belief as being divinely revealed," 4 19 and
as the teaching of Christ, the definitions "must be adhered to with
the obedience of faith." 420 This infallibility extends as far as the
deposit of divine Revelation itsel£. 42 1

892
Divine assistance is also given to the successors of the
apostles, teaching in communion with the successor of Peter, and,
in a particular way, to the bishop of Rome, pastor of the whole
Church, when, without arriving at an infallible definition and
without pronouncing in a "definitive manner," they propose in the
exercise of the ordinary Magisterium a teaching that leads to better
understanding of Revelation in matters of faith and morals. To this
ordinary teaching the faithful "are to adhere to it with religious
assent" 422 which, though distinct from the assent of faith, is none­
theless an extension of it.
The sanctifying office

893
The bishop is "the steward of the grace of the supreme
priesthood," 423 especially in the Eucharist which he offers person1561 ally or whose offering he assures through the priests, his co-work­
ers. The Eucharist is the center of the life of the particular Church.
The bishop and priests sanctify the Church by their prayer and
work, by their ministry of the word and of the sacraments. They
sanctify her by their example, "not as domineering over those in
your charge but being examples to the flock." 424 Thus, "together
with the flock entrusted to them, they may attain to etemal life."425
The governing office

894
"The bishops, as vicars and legates of Christ, govern the
particular Churches assigned to them by their counsels, exhorta­
tions, and example, but over and above that also by the authority
801 and sacred power" which indeed they ought to exercise so as to
edify, in the spirit of service which is that of their Master. 426

The Profession of Faith

895
"The power which they exercise personally in the name of
Christ, is proper, ordinary, and immediate, although its exercise is
ultimately controlled by the supreme authority of the Church."427 1558
But the bishops should not be thought of as vicars of the Pope. His
ordinary and immediate authority over the whole Church does not
annul, but on the contrary confirms and defends that of the bishops. Their authority must be exercised in communion with the
whole Church under the guidance of the Pope.
896
The Good Shepherd ought to be the model and "form" of
the bishop's pastoral office. Conscious of his own weaknesses, "the
bishop . . . can have compassion for those who are ignorant and
erring. He should not refuse to listen to his subjects whose welfare 1550
he promotes as of his very own children . . . . The faithful . . . should
be closely attached to the bishop as the Church is to Jesus Christ,
and as Jesus Christ is to the Father": 428
Let all follow the bishop, as Jesus Christ follows his Father,
and the college of presbyters as the apostles; respect the
deacons as you do God's law. Let no one do anything con­
cerning the Church in separation from the bishop. 429

THE LAY FAITHFUL

897
"The term 'laity' is here understood to mean all the faithful
except those in Holy Orders and those who belong to a religious
state approved by the Church. That is, the faithful, who by Baptism 873
are incorporated into Christ and integrated into the People of God,
are made sharers in their particular way in the priestly, prophetic,
and kingly office of Christ, and have their own part to play in the
mission of the whole Christian people in the Church and in the
world."430
The vocation of lay people

898
"By reason of their special vocation it belongs to the laity
to seek the kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and
directing them according to God's will . . . . It pertains to them in a 2 1 05
special way so to illuminate and order all temporal things with
which they are closely associated that these may always be effected

and grow according to Christ and may be to the glory of the Creator
and Redeemer." 431

899
The initiative of lay Christians is necessary especially
when the matter involves discovering or inventing the means for
2442 permeating social, political, and economic realities with the de­
mands of Christian doctrine and life. This initiative is a normal
element of the life of the Church:
Lay believers are in the front line of Church life; for them the
Church is the anima ting principle of human society. There­
fore, they in particular ought to have an ever-clearer con­
sciousness not only of belonging to the Church, but of being
the Church, that is to say, the community of the faithful on
earth under the leadership of the Pope, the common Head,
and of the bishops in communion with him. They are the
C hurch . 432

Since, like all the faithful, lay Christians are entrusted by
900
God with the apostolate by virtue of their Baptism and Confirma863 tion, they have the right and duty, individually or grouped in
associations, to work so that the divine message of salvation may
be known and accepted by all men throughout the earth. This duty
is the more pressing when it is only through them that men can
hear the Gospel and know Christ. Their activity in ecclesial com­
munities is so necessary that, for the most part, the apostolate of
the pastors cannot be fully effective without it. 433
The p articipation of lay people in Christ's priestly office

901
"Hence the laity, dedicated as they are to Christ and
anointed by the Holy Spirit, are marvellously called and prepared
784, 1268 so that even richer fruits of the Spirit may be produced in them. For
all their works, prayers, and apostolic undertakings, family and
married life, daily work, relaxation of mind and body, if they are
accomplished in the Spirit - indeed even the hardships of life if
patiently born - all these become spiritual sacrifices acceptable to
God through Jesus Christ. In the celebration of the Eucharist these
may most fittingly be offered to the Father along with the body of
the Lord. And so, worshipping everywhere by their holy actions,
358 the laity consecrate the world itself to God, everywhere offering
worship by the holiness of their lives. "434

In a very special way, parents share in the office of sanctifying
"by leading a conjugal life in the Christian spirit and by seeing to the
Christian education of their children." 435

903
Lay people who possess the required qualities can be admitted
permanently to the ministries of lector and acolyte.436 When the necessity
of the Church warrants it and when ministers are lacking, lay persons,
even if they are not lectors or acolytes, can also supply for certain of their
offices, namely, to exercise the ministry of the word, to preside over
liturgical prayers, to confer Bap tism, and to distribute Holy Communion
in accord with the prescriptions of law. 43 7

Participation in Christ's prophetic office

904
"Christ . . . fulfills this prophetic office, not only by the
hierarchy . . . but also by the laity. He accordingly both establishes 785
them as witnesses and provides them with the sense of the faith 92
[sensus fidei] and the grace of the word" 438
To teach in order to lead others to faith is the task of every
preacher and of each believer.439

Lay people also fulfill their prophetic mission by evangeli- 2044
905
zation, "that is, the proclamation of Christ by word and the testi­
mony of life." For lay people, "this evangelization . . . acquires a
specific property and peculiar efficacy because it is accomplished
in the ordinary circumstances of the world. "440
This witness of life, however, is not the sole element in the
apostolate; the true apostle is on the lookout for occasions of
announcing Christ by word, either to unbelievers . . . or to

Lay people who are capable and trained may also collaborate in
catechetical formation, in teaching the sacred sciences, and in use of the
communications media. 442

"In accord with the knowledge, competence, and preeminence
which they possess, [lay people] have the right and even at times a duty
to manifest to the sacred pastors their opinion on matters which pertain to
the good of the Church, and they have a right to make their opinion known
to the other Christian faithful, with due regard to the integrity of faith and

morals and reverence toward their pastors, and with consideration for the
common good and the dignity of persons."443

Participation in Christ's kingly office

908

By his obedience unto death,444 Christ communicated to

his disciples the gift of royal freedom, so tha t they might "by the

786

self-abnegation of a holy life, overcome the reign of sin in them­

selves":44 5

That man is rightly called a king who makes his own body
an obedient subject and, by governing himself with suitable
rigor, refuses to let his passions breed rebellion in his soul,
for he exercises a kind of royal power over himself. And
because he knows how to rule his own person as king, so too
does he sit as its judge. He will not let himself be imprisoned
by sin, or thrown headlong into wickedness.446

909

"Moreover, by uniting their forces let the laity so remedy

the institutions and conditions of the world when the latter are an

1 887

inducement to sin, that these may be conformed to the norms of

justice, favoring rather than hindering the practice of virtue. By so
doing they will impregnate culture and human works with a moral

value ."447

910

"The laity can also feel called, or be in fact called, to

cooperate with their pastors in the service of the ecclesial commu-

799

nity, for the sake of its growth and life. This can be done through
the exercise of different kinds of ministries according to the grace

and charisms which the Lord has been pleased to bes tow on
them."448

911
In the Church, "lay members of the Christian faithful can coop­
erate in the exercise of this power [of governance] in accord with the norm
of law."449 And so the Church provides for their presence at particular
councils, diocesan synods, pastoral councils; the exercise of the pastoral
care of a parish, collaboration in finance committees, and participation in
ecclesiastical tribunals, etc. 450

They will strive to unite the two harmoniously, remembering that

THE CONSECRATED

the evangelical counsels, while not entering into the hierarchical

structure of the Church, belongs undeniably to her life and holi-

ness ."453

2 1 03

Evangelical counsels, consecrated life

915

Christ proposes the evangelical counsels, in their great

varie ty, to every disciple. The perfection of charity, to which all the
faithful are called, entails for those who freely follow the call to

1973-1 974

consecrated life the obligation of practicing chastity in celibacy for
the sake of the Kingdom, poverty and obedience. It is the profession

of these counsels, within a permanent state of life recognized by
the Church, that characterizes the life consecrated to G o d .454

916

The state of consecrated life is thus one way of experienc­

ing a "more intimate" consecration, rooted in Baptism and dedicated totally to God .455 In the consecrated life, Christ's faithful,

2687

moved by the Holy Spirit, propose to follow Christ more nearly, to
give themselves to God who is loved above all and, pursuing the
perfection of charity in the service of the Kingdom, to signify and
proclaim in the Church the glory of the world to come . 456

One great tree, with many branches

917
"From the God-given seed of the counsels a wonderful and
wide-spreading tree has grown up in the field of the Lord, branch2684 ing out into various forms of the religious life lived in solitude or
in community. Different religious families have come into exist­
ence in which spiritual resources are multiplied for the progress in
holiness of their members and for the good of the entire Body of
Christ."457
918
From the very beginning of the Church there were men and
women who set out to follow Christ with greater liberty, and to imitate
him more closely, by practicing the evangelical counsels. They led lives
dedicated to God, each in his own way. Many of them, under the inspira­
tion of the Holy Spirit, became hermits or founded reli gious families. These
the Church, by virtue of her authority, gladly accepted and approved.458
919
Bishops will always strive to discern new gifts of conse­
crated life granted to the Church by the Holy Spirit; the approval
of new forms of consecrated life is reserved to the Apostolic See.459
The eremitic life

920
Without always professing the three evangelical counsels
publicly, hermits "devote their life to the praise of God and salva­
tion of the world through a stricter separation from the world, the
silence of solitude and assiduous prayer and penance."460
921
They manifest to everyone the interior aspect of the mys­

the sake of the Kingdom of heaven. "463

923

"Virgins who, committed to the holy plan of following

Christ more closely, are consecrated to God by the diocesan bishop

according to the approved liturgical rite, are betrothed mystically

1537

to Christ, the Son of God, and are dedicated to the service of the
Church . "464 By this solemn rite (Consecratio Virginum), the virgin is

1672

"constituted . . . a sacred person, a transcendent sign of the Church's
love for Christ, and an eschatological image of this heavenly Bride

of Christ and of the life to come."465

924

"As with other forms of consecrated life," the order of

virgins establishes the woman living in the world (or the nun) in
prayer, penance, service of her brethren, and apostolic ac tivity,
according to the state of life and spiritual gifts given to her. 466
Consecrated virgins can form themselves into associations to ob­

serve their commitment more faithfully. 467

Religious life

925

Religious life was born in the East during the first centuries

of Christianity. Lived within institutes canonically erected by the
Church, it is distinguished from other forms of consecrated life by
its liturgical character, public profession of the evangelical coun-

sels, fraternal life led in common, and witness given to the union
of Christ with the Church.468

926

1672

Religious life derives from the mystery of the Church. It is

a gift she has received from her Lord, a gift she offers as a stable
way of life to the faithful called by God to profess the counsels.

Thus, the Church can both show forth Christ and acknowledge

herself to be the Savior's bride. Religious life in its various forms is
called to signify the very charity of God in the language of our time.

927

All religious, whether exempt or not, take their place

among the collaborators of the diocesan bishop in his p astoral
duty.469 From the outset of the work of evangelization, the missionary "planting" and expansion of the Church require the presence

Secular institutes

928

"A secular institute is an institute of consecrated life

the Christian faithful living in the world strive for the perfection of charity

task of evangelization, "in the world and from within the world,"

901

where their presence acts as "leaven in the worl d . "473 "Their wit­

ness of a Christian life" aims "to order temporal things according

to God and inform the world with the power of the gospel . " They

commit themselves to the evangelical counsels by sacred bonds
and observe among themselves the communion and fellowship
appropriate to their "particular secular way of life."4 74

Societies of apostolic life

930

Alongside the different forms of consecrated life are "so­

cieties of apostolic life whose members without religious vows

pursue the particular apostolic purpose of their society, and lead a

life as brothers or sisters in common according to a particular

manner of life, strive for the perfection of charity through the

observance of the constitutions . Among these there are societies in

which the members embrace the evangelical counsels" according

wonderfully in her. And so the first mission of those who profess
the evangelical counsels is to live out their consecration. Moreover,
"since members of institutes of consecrated life ded icate them­
selves through their consecration to the service of the Church they
are obliged in a special manner to engage in missionary work, in
accord with the character of the institu te."476

932
In the Church, which is like the sacrament - the sign and
instrument - of God's own life, the consecrated life is seen as a special
sign of the mystery of redemption. To follow and imitate Christ more 775
nearly and to manifest more clearly his self-emptying is to be more
deeply present to one's contemporaries, in the heart of Christ. For those
who are on this "narrower" path encourage their brethren by their
example, and bear striking witness "that the world cannot be transfigured and offered to God without the spirit of the Beatitudes."477
Whether their witness is public, as in the religious state, or
less public, or even secret, Christ's coming remains for all those
consecrated both the origin and rising sun of their life:
672

933

For the People of God has here no lasting city, . . . [and this
state] reveals more clearly to all believers the heavenly goods
which are already present in this age, witnessing to the new
and eternal life which we have acquired through the redemptive work of Christ and preluding our future resurrection and the glory of the heavenly kingdom. 478

IN BRIEF
934

"Among the Christian faithful by divine institution
there exist in the Church sacred ministers, who are also
called clerics in law, and other Christian faithful who
are also called laity." In both groups there are those
Christian faithful who, professing the evangelical
counsels, are consecrated to God and so serve the
Church's saving mission (d. CIC, can. 207 § 1, 2).

935

To proclaim the faith and to plant his reign, Christ
sends his apostles and their successors. He gives them
a share in his own mission. From him they receive the
power to act in his person.

bishop of the Church of Rome, successor to St. Peter, is
"head of the college of bishops, the Vicar of Christ and
Pastor of the universal Church on earth" (CIC, can.

331).

The Pope enjoys, by divine institution, " supreme, full, imme­
diate, and universal power in the care of souls" (CD 2).

938

The Bishops, established by the Holy Spirit, succeed the
apostles. They are "the visible source and foundation of
unity in their own particular Churches"

939

(LG 23).

Helped by the priests, their co-workers, and by the
deacons, the bishops have the duty of authentically
teaching the faith, celebrating divine worship, above
all the Eucharist, and guiding their Churches as true
pastors . Their responsibility also includes concern for
all the Churches, with and under the Pope.

940

"The characteristic of the lay state being a life led in the
midst of the world and of secular affairs, lay people
are called by God to make of their apostolate, through
the vigor of their Christian spirit, a leaven in the
world "

941

(AA 2 § 2).

Lay people share in Christ's priesthood: ever more
united with him, they exhibit the grace of Baptism and
Confirmation in all dimensions of their personal, fam­
ily, social, and ecclesial lives, and so fulfill the call to
holiness addressed to all the baptized .

942

By virtue of their prophetic mission, lay people "are called
. . . to be witnesses to Christ in all circumstances and at the
very heart of the community of mankind"

943

(GS 43 § 4).

By virtue of their kinglymission, laypeople have the power
to uproot the rule of sin within themselves and in the world,

by their self-denial and holiness of life (cf. LG 36).

944

The life consecrated to God is characterized by the
public profession of the evangelical counsels of pov­

recognized by the Church.

Paragraph 5 . The Communion of S aints

946

After confessing "the holy catholic Church," the Apostles'

Creed adds "the communion of saints . "

In

a certain sense this

article is a further explanation of the preceding: "What is the
Church if not the assembly of all the saints?" 479 The communion

823

of saints is the Church.

947

"Since all the faithful form one body, the good of each is

communicated to the others . . . . We must therefore believe that
there exis ts a communion of goods in the Church. But the most
important member is Christ, since he is the head . . . . Therefore, the

790

riches of Christ are communicated to all the members, through the

sacrarnents ."480 "As this Church is governed by one and the same

Spirit, all the goods she has received necessarily become a common
fund."481

948

The term " communion of saints " therefore has two closely

l inked me anings : communion " in holy things
"among holy persons

(sancta) "

and

1331

(sancti) ."

Sancta sanctis! ("God's holy gifts for God's holy people") is
proclaimed by the celebrant in most Eastern liturgies during
the elevation of the holy Gifts before the distribution of
communion. The faithful (sancti) are fed by Christ's holy
body and blood (sancta) to grow in the communion of the
Holy Spirit (koinonia) and to communicate it to the world.

In the primitive community of Jerusalem, the disciples

"devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to
the breaking of the bread and the prayers." 482

Communion in the faith.

The faith of the faithful is the faith

uniting the faithful with one another and binding them to Jesus

Church. The communion of saints must be unders tood as the
communion of the sacraments . . . . The name 'communion' can be

1 331

is better suited to the Eucharist than to any other, because it is

primarily the Eucharist that brings this communion about."483

good . "485

952

"They had everything in common. "486

"Everything the true

Christian has is to be regarded as a good possessed in common with

Christian is a steward of the Lord's goods. 488

Communion in charity. In the sanctorum communio, "None

member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all
rejoice together. Now you are the body of Christ and individually

201 1

members of it."490 "Charity does not insist on its own way . "49 1

In

this solidarity with all men, living or dead, which is founded on the

845, 1 469

communion of saints, the least of our acts done in charity redounds
to the profit of all. Every sin harms this communion.

The three states of the Church.

"When the Lord comes in

glory, and all his angels with him, death will be no more and all
things will be subject to him . But at the present time some of his
disciples are pilgrims on earth. Others have died and are being
purified, while still others are in glory, contemplating 'in full light,

God himself triune and one, exactly as he is"': 492

771
1031
1 023

All of us, however, in varyi ng degrees and in different ways
share in the same charity towards God and our neighbours,
and we all sing the one hymn of glory to our God. All,
indeed, who are of Christ and who have his Spirit form one
Church and in Christ cleave together.493

955

"So it is that the union of the wayfarers with the brethren

who sleep in the peace of Christ is in no way interrupted, but on
the contrary, according to the constant faith of the Church, this

union is reinforced by an exchange of spiritual goods ."494

956

The in tercession of the saints.

"Being more closely united to

Christ, those who dwell in heaven fix the whole Church more
firmly in holiness. . . . [T]hey do not cease to intercede with the
Father for us, as they proffer the merits which they acquired on

earth through the one mediator between God and men, Christ

IN BRIEF

The Church is a "communion of saints": this expres­
sion refers first to the "holy things"

(sancta), above all

the Eucharist, by which "the unity of believers, who

form one body in Christ, is both represented and
brought about"

961

(LG 3).

The term "communion of sa ints" refers also t o the
communion of "holy persons"

(sancti)

in Christ who

"died for all," so that what each one does or suffers in
and for Christ bears fru it for all.

962

"We believe in the communion of all the faithful of

Christ, those who are pilgrims on earth, the dead who
are being purified, and the blessed in heaven, all to­

MARY'S MOTHERHOOD WITH REGARD TO THE CHURCH

Wholly united with her Son . . .

964

Mary's role in the Church is inseparable from her union

with Christ and flows directly from it. "This union of the mother
with the Son in the work of salvation is made manifest from the
time of Christ's virginal conception up to his death ";5°4 it is made
manifest above all at the hour of his P assion:

Thus the Blessed Virgin advanced in her pilgrimage of faith,
and faithfully persevered in her union with her Son unto the
cross. There she stood, in keeping with the divine plan,
enduring with her only begotten Son the intensity of his
suffering, joining herself with his sacrifice in her mother's
heart, and lovingly consenting to the immolation of this
victim, born of her: to be given, by the same Christ Jesus
dying on the cross, a s a mother to his disciple, with these
words: "Woman, behold your son."505

965

After her Son's Ascension, Mary " aided the beginnings of

the Church by her prayers. " 506

In her association with the apostles

and several women, "we also see Mary by her prayers imploring

the Lord as Queen over all things, so that she might be the more

fully conformed to her Son, the Lord of lords and conqueror of sin

and death . " 508 The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin is a singular
participation in her Son's Resurrection and an anticip ation of the
resurrection of other Christians:
In giving birth you kept your virginity; in your Dormition
you did not leave the world, 0 Mother of God, but were
joined to the source of Life. You conceived the living God
and, by your prayers, will deliver our souls from death. 509

. . . she is our Mother in the order of grace

967

By her complete adherence to the Father's will, to his Son's

redemptive work, and to every prompting of the Holy Spirit, the

Virgin Mary is the Church's model of faith and charity. Thus she

507

is a "preeminent and . . . wholly unique member of the Church";
indeed, she is the "exemplary realization" (typus) 51 0 of the Church.

Her role in relation to the Church and to all humanity goes

still further.

From the most ancient times the Blessed Virgin has been honored

with the title of 'Mother of God,' to whose pro tection the faithful
fly in all their dangers and needs . . . . This very special devotion . . .

differs essentially from the adoration which is given to the incar-

nate Word and equally to the Father and the Holy Spirit, and
greatly fosters this adoration." 5 16 The liturgical feasts dedicated to

The Apostle's Creed associates faith in the forgiveness of

sins not only with faith in the Holy Spirit, but also with faith in the
Church and in the communion of saints. It was when he gave the

his own divine power to forgive sins: "Receive the Holy Spirit. If
you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins
of any, they are retained . " 520

ONE BAPTISM FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS

977

Our Lord tied the forgiveness of sins to faith and Baptism:

1 2 63

"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole crea tion.
He who believes and is bap tized will be saved . " 521 Baptism is the
first and chief sacrament of forgiveness of sins because it unites us

with Christ, who died for our sins and rose for our justification, so
tha t "we too might walk in newness of life . " 522

"When we made our first profession of faith while receiv­

978

ing the holy Bap tism that cleansed us, the forgiveness we received
then was so full and complete that there remained in us absolutely
nothing left to efface, neither original sin nor offenses committed
by our own will, nor was there left any penalty to suffer in order
to expiate them . . . . Yet the grace of B ap tism delivers no one from

all the weakness of na ture . On the contrary, we must s till combat
the movements of concupiscence that never cease leading us into

evil." 523

979

1264

In this battle against our inclination towards evil, who

could be brave and watchful enough to escape every wound of sin?

"If the Church has the power to forgive sins, then Baptism cann o t

be her only means of using the keys of the Kingdom of heaven
received from Jesus Christ. The Church must be able to forgive all

1 446

penitents their offenses, even if they should sin until the las t
moment of their lives . " 524

980

It is through the sacrament of Penance that the bap tized

can be reconciled with God and with the Church:
Penance has rightly been called by the holy Fathers "a labo­
rious kind of baptism." This sacrament of Penance is neces­
sary for salvation for those who have fallen after Baptism,
just as Baptism is necessary for salvation for those who have
not yet been reborn.525

THE POWER OF THE KEYS

981

After his Resurrection, Christ sent his apos tles "so that

repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name
to all nations ." 5 26 The apostles and their successors carry out this

"ministry of reconciliation," not only by announcing to men God's

forgiveness merited for us by Christ, and calling them to conver­
sion and faith; but also by communica ting to them the forgiveness

1 444 of sins in Bap tism, and reconciling them with God and with the
Church through the power of the keys, received from Christ: 527
[The Church] has received the keys of the Kingdom of
heaven so tha t, in her, sins may be forgiven through Christ's
blood and the Holy Spirit's action. In this Church, the soul
dead through sin comes back to life in order to live with
Christ, whose grace has saved us. 528

553

982

There is no offense, however serious, that the Church

cannot forgive. "There is no one, however wicked and guilty, who

1 463 may not confidently hope for forgiveness, provided his repentance
605 is honest. " 529 Christ who died for all men desires that in his Church
the gates of forgiveness should always be open to anyone who
turns away from sin. 530

983
Catechesis strives to awaken and nourish in the faithful
1 442 faith in the incomparable greatness of the risen Christ's gift to his
Church: the mission and the power to forgive sins through the
ministry of the apostles and their successors:
The Lord wills that his disciples possess a tremendous
power: that his lowly servants accomplish in his name all
that he did when he was on earth. 531

1 465

Priests have received from God a power that he has given
neither to angels nor to archan els . . . . God above confirms
wha t priests do here below. 53

:f

Were there no forgiveness of sins in the Church, there would
be no hope of life to come or eternal liberation. Let us thank
God who has given his Church such a gift. 533

The Profession of Faith

257

IN BRIEF
984

The Creed links " the forgiveness of sins" with its
profession of faith in the Holy Spirit, for the risen
Christ entrusted to the apostles the power to forgive
sins when he gave them the Holy Spirit.

985

Bap tism is the first and chief s acrament of the forgive­

ness of sins: it unites us to Christ, who died and rose,
and gives us the Holy Spirit.

986

By Chris t's will, the Church possesses the power to
forgive the s ins of the bap tized and exercises it

through bishops and priests normally in the sacrament
of Penance.

987

"In the forgiveness of sins, both priests and sacraments
are ins truments which our Lord Jesus Christ, the only

author and liberal giver of salvation, wills to use in
order to efface our sins and give us the grace of justi­

fication"

(Roman Catechism, I, 1 1 , 6) .

"I BELIEVE I N THE RESURRECTION
OF THE BODY"

988

The Christian Creed - the profession of our faith in God,

the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and in God's creative,
saving, and sanctifying action - culminates in the proclamation of
the resurrection of the dead on the last day and in life everlasting.

989

We firmly believe, and hence we hope that, just as Christ

is truly risen from the dead and lives for ever, so after death the

655 righteous will live for ever with the risen Christ and he will raise
648 them up on the last day. 534 Our resurrection, like his own, will be
the work of the Most Holy Trinity:

If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in
you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life
to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit who dwells in
you. 535

364

990
The term "flesh" refers to man in his state of weakness and
mortality. 536 The "resurrection of the flesh" (the literal formulation of the
Apostles' Creed) means not only that the immortal soul will live on after
death, but that even our "mortal body" will come to life again. 537
991

Belief in the resurrection of the dead has been an essential

638 element of the Christian faith from its beginnings. "The confidence
of Christians is the resurrection of the dead; believing this we

l ive. "538

How can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the
dead? But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ
has not been raised; if Christ has not been raised, then our
preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain . . . . But in fact
Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those
who have fallen asleep .539

CHRIST'S RESURRECTION AND OURS

The progressive revelation of the Resurrection
992

God revealed the resurrection of the dead to his people

progressively. Hope in the bodily resurrection of the dead estab­
lished itself as a consequence intrinsic to faith in God as creator of
the whole man, soul and body. The creator of heaven and earth is

also the one who faithfully maintains his covenant with Abraham

and his posterity. It was in this double perspective that faith in the
resurrection came to be expressed.

In

297

their trials, the Maccabean

martyrs confessed :
The King of the universe will raise us up to an everlasting
renewal of life, because we have died for his laws.54° One
cannot but choose to die at the hands of men and to cherish
the hope that God gives of being raised again by him.54 1

993

The Pharisees and many of the Lord's contemporaries

hoped for the resurrection. Jesus teaches it firmly. To the Sadducees

who deny it he answers, "Is not this why you are wrong, that you
know neither the scrip tures nor the power of God ?" 542 Faith in the
resurrection rests on faith in God who "is not God of the dead, but
of the living. " 543

994

575

205

But there is more . Jesus links faith in the resurrection to his

own person: "I am the Resurrection and the life . " 544 It is Jesus

himself who on the last day will raise up those who have believed
in him, who have eaten his body and drunk his blood . 545 Already

now in this present life he gives a sign and pledge of this by
restoring some of the dead to life,546 announcing thereby his own

646

Resurrection, though it was to be of another order. He speaks of
this unique event as the "sign of Jonah,"54 7 the sign of the temple:
he announces that he will be put to death but rise thereafter on the
third day. 548

995

To be a witness to Christ is to be a "witness to his Resur-

rection," to " [have eaten and drunk] with him after he rose from

the dead . " 549 Encounters with the risen Christ characterize the

Christian hope of resurrec tion. We shall rise like Christ, with him,
and through him.

996

From the beginning, Christian faith in the resurrection has

met with incomprehension and opposition . 55 0 "On no point does

643 the Christian faith encounter more opposition than on the resur­

rection of the body." 55 1 It is very commonly accep ted tha t the life

of the human person continues in a spiritual fashion after death.
But how can we believe that this body, so clearly mortal, could rise
to everlasting life?

How do the dead rise?

997

What is "rising"? In death,

the separation of the soul from

the body, the human body decays and the soul goes to meet God,

366 while awaiting its reunion with its glorified body. God, in his

almighty power, will definitively grant incorruptible life to our
bodies by reuniting them with our souls, through the power of
Jesus' Resurrec tion.

998

Who will rise ? All the dead will

rise, " those who have done

good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to

1 038 the resurrection of judgment."552

999

How?

Christ is raised with his own body: "See my hands

and my feet, that it is I myself";553 but he did not return to an earthly
life. So, in him, "all of them will rise again with their own bodies

640 which they now bear," but Christ "will change our lowly body to
645 be like his glorious body," into a "spiritual body": 554
But someone will ask, "How are the dead raised? With what
kind of body do they come?" You foolish man! What you
sow does not come to life unless it dies. And what you sow
is not the body which is to be, but a bare kernel . . . . What is
sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable . . . . The
dead will be raised imperishable . . . . For this perishable
nature must put on the im erishable, and this mortal nature
must put on immortality. 55

261

This "how" exceeds our imagination and understanding;

it is accessible only to faith. Yet our participation in the Eucharist
already gives us a foretaste of Christ's transfiguration of our bodies:
Just as bread that comes from the earth, after God's blessing
has been invoked upon it, is no longer ordinary bread, but
Eucharist, formed of two things, the one earthly and the
other heavenly: so too our bodies, which partake of the
Eucharist, are no longer corruptible, but possess the hope of
resurrection.556

1001

When ? Definitively "at the last day," "at the end of the
557
world ."
Indeed, the resurrection of the dead is closely associated

647
1405

1 038
673

with Christ's Parousia:
For the Lord himself will descend from heaven, with a cry
of command, with the archangel's call, and with the sound
of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise
first. 558

Risen with Christ

1002

Christ will raise us up "on the last day"; but it is also true

that, in a certain way, we have already risen with Christ. For, by
virtue of the Holy Spirit, Christian life is already now on earth a 655
participation in the death and Resurrection of Christ:
And you were buried with him in Baptism, in which you
were also raised with him through faith in the working of
God, who raised him from the dead . . . . If then you have
been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where
Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 559

1003

United with Christ by Baptism, believers already truly

participate in the heavenly life of the risen Christ, but this life

remains "hidden with Christ in God. "560 The Father has already 1227

dignity entails the demand that he should treat with respect his

own body, but also the body of every other person, especially the

suffering:

The body [is meant] for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his
power. Do you not know that your bodies are members of
Christ? . . . . You are not your own; . . . . So glorify God in

DYING IN CHRIST JESUS

1005

To rise with Christ, we must die with Chris t: we must "be

away from the body and at home with the Lord . " 564

In

that "de­

parture" which is death the soul is separated from the body. 565 It

650

will be reunited with the body on the day of resurrection of the
dead. 566

Death

1006

"It is in regard to death that man's condition is most

shrouded in doubt." 567 In a sense bod ily death is natural, but for
faith it is in fact "the wages of sin." 568 For those who die in Christ's
grace i t is a participation in the death of the Lord, so that they can
also share his Resurrection.569

1007

Death is the end of earthly life.

Our lives are measured by

time, in the course of which we change, grow old and, as with all

living beings on earth, death seems like the normal end of life. That
aspect of death lends urgency to our lives: remembering our mor­

tality helps us realize that we have only a limited time in which to

bring our lives to fulfillment:

Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, . . .
before the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit
returns to God who gave it. 570

Death is a consequence of sin . The Church's Magis terium, as

die. Death was therefore contrary to the plans of God the Creator
and entered the world as a consequence of sin. 5 72 "Bodily death,

Jesus, the Son of God, also

himself suffered the death that is part of the human condition. Yet,
despite his anguish as he faced death, he accep ted it in an act of

The meaning of Christian death

1 681-1 690

complete and free submission t o his Father's will. 574 The obedience
of Jesus has transformed the curse of death into a blessing. 5 75

Because of Christ, Christian death has a positive meaning:
"For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain." 5 76 "The saying is
sure: if we have died with him, we will also live with him . "577 What

1010

is essentially new about Christian death is this: through Baptism,
the Christian has already "died with Christ" sacramentally, in
order to live a new life; and if we die in Christ's grace, physical

1 220

death completes this "dying with Christ" and so completes our
incorporation into him in his redeeming act:
It is better for me to die in (eis) Christ Jesus than to reign over
the ends of the earth. Him it is I seek - who died for us. Him
it is I desire - who rose for us. I am on the point of giving
birth . . . . Let me receive pure light; when I shall have arrived
578"
there, then shall I be a man.

1011

In death, God calls man to himself. Therefore the Christian

can experience a desire for death like St. Paul's : "My desire is to
depart and be with Christ." 5 79 He can transform his own death into

an act of obedience and love towards the Father, after the example

of Christ: 580

The Christian vision of death receives privileged expres-

Lord, for your faithful people life is changed, not ended .
When the body of our earthly dwelling lies in death
we gain an everlasting dwelling place in heaven.585

1013

Death

is

the end of man's earthly pilgrimage, of the time of

grace and mercy which God offers

him so as to work out his earthly

life in keeping with the divine plan, and to decide his ultimate destiny.
When "the single course of our earthly life" is completed,586 we shall not

return to other earthly lives: "It is appointed for men to die once."587

There is no "reincarnation" after death.

1014

The Church encourages us to prepare ourselves for the

hour of our death. In the ancient litany of the saints, for instance,

she has us pray: "From a sudden and unforeseen death, deliver us,
0 Lord"; 588 to ask the Mother of God to intercede for us "at the
hour of our death" in the

Ha il Ma ry; and to entrust ourselves to St.

2676-2 677 Joseph, the patron of a happy death.
Every action of yours, every thought, should be those of one
who expects to die before the day is out. Death would have
no great terrors for you if you had a quiet conscience . . . .
Then why not keep clear of sin instead of running away from
death? If you aren't fit to face death today, it's very unlikely
you will be tomorrow . . . _589
Praised are you, my Lord, for our sister bodily Death,
from whom no living man can escape.
Woe on those who will die in mortal sin!

in your most holy will,

"The flesh is the hinge of salva tion" (Tertullian, De res.

flesh; we believe in the Word made flesh in order to
redeem the flesh; we believe in the resurrection of the
flesh, the fulfillment of both the creation and the re­
demption of the flesh.

1016

By death the soul is separated from the body, but in
the resurrection God will give incorruptible life to our
body, transformed by reunion with our soul . Just as
Christ is risen and lives for ever, so all of us will rise at
the last day.

As a consequence of original sin, man must suffer

THE PARTICULAR JUDGMENT

1021

Death puts an end to human life as the time open to either

accep ting or rejec ting the d ivine grace manifested in Christ. 592 The
New Testament speaks of jud gment primarily in its aspect of the
final encounter with Christ in his second coming, but also repeat­

edly affirms that each will be rewarded immediately after death in

679 accordance with his works and faith . The parable of the poor man
Lazarus and the words of Christ on the cross to the good thief, as
well as other New Testament texts speak of a final destiny of the

HEAVEN

1023

Those who die in God's grace and friendship and are

perfectly purified live for ever with Chris t. They are like God for
ever, for they "see him as he is," face to face: 598

1 470

954

By virtue of our apostolic authority, we define the following:
According to the general disposition of God, the souls of all
the saints . . . and other faithful who died after receiving
Christ's holy Baptism (provided they were not in need of
purification when they died, . . . or, if they then did need or
will need some purification, when they have been purified
after death, . . . ) already before they take up their bodies
again and before the general judgment - and this since the
Ascension of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ into heaven
- have been, are and will be in heaven, in the heavenly
Kingdom and celestial paradise with Christ, joined to the
company of the holy angels. Since the Passion and death of
our Lord Jesus Christ, these souls have seen and do see the
divine essence with an intuitive vision, and even face to face,
without the mediation of any creature. 599

1024

This perfect life with the Most Holy Trinity - this commun­

ion of life and love with the Trinity, with the Virgin Mary, the
angels and all the blessed - is called "heaven. " Heaven is the

ultimate end and fulfillment of the deepest human longings, the

260, 326
2 794, 1 71 8

s tate o f supreme, definitive happiness .

1025

To live in heaven is "to be with Chris t." The elect live "in

Christ," 600 but they retain, or rather find, their true identity, their
own name. 601
For life is to be with Christ; where Christ is, there is life, there
is the kingdom. 602

Part One

1026

By his death and Resurrection, Jesus Christ has " opened"

heaven to us. The life of the blessed consists in the full and perfect
possession of the fruits of the redemption accomplished by Christ.
He makes partners in his heavenly glorification those who have

793 believed in him and remained faithful to his will. Heaven is the
blessed community of all who are perfectly incorporated into
Christ.

1027

This mystery of blessed communion with God and all who

are in Christ is beyond all understanding and descrip tion . Scripture

959, 1 720 speaks of it in images: life, light, peace, wedding feast, wine of the
kingdom, the Father's house, the heavenly Jerusalem, paradise:
"no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived,
what God has prepared for those who love him." 603

1028

B ecause of his transcendence, God cannot be seen as he is,

1 722, unless he himself opens up his mystery to man's immediate con1 63 templation and gives him the capacity for it. The Church calls this
contemplation of God in his heavenly glory " the beatific vision":
How great will your glory and happiness be, to be allowed
to see God, to be honored with sharing the joy of salvation
and eternal light with Christ your Lord and God, . . . to
delight in the joy of immortality in the Kingdom of heaven
04
with the righteous and God's friends. 6

956 1029
In the glory of heaven the blessed continue joyfully to
668 fulfill God's will in relation to other men and to all creation.
Already they reign with Chris t; with him "they shall reign for ever
and ever." 605

THE fiNAL PURIFICATION, OR PURGATORY

1030

All who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imper­

fectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but
after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness
necessary to enter the joy of heaven .

1031

The Church gives the name

Purgatory to this final purifica-

954, 1 472 tion of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of
the damned. 606 The Church formula ted her doctrine of faith on

The Profession of Faith

269

Purgatory especially at the Councils of Florence and Trent. The
tradition of the Church, by reference to certain texts of Scripture,

speaks of a cleansing fire: 607

As for certain lesser faults, we must believe that, before the
Final Judgment, there is a purifying fire. He who is truth says
that whoever utters blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will
be pardoned neither in this age nor in the age to come. From
this sentence we understand that certain offenses can be
forgiven in this age, but certain others in the age to come.60S

1032

This teaching is also based on the practice of prayer for the

dead, already mentioned in Sacred Scripture: "Therefore Uudas

958

Maccabeus] made atonement for the dead, that they might b e
delivered from their sin. "609 From the beginning the Church has

13 71

honored the memory of the dead and offered prayers in suffrage
for them, above all the Eucharistic sacrifice, so that, thus purified,

they may attain the beatific vision of God. 610 The Church also

1 479

commends almsgiving, indulgences, and works of penance undertaken on behalf of the dead:
Let us help and commemorate them. If Job's sons were
purified by their father's sacrifice, why would we doubt that
our offerings for the dead bring them some consolation? Let
us not hesitate to help those who have died and to offer our
6
prayers for them. 1 1

IV.

HELL

1033

We cannot be united with God unless we freely choose to

love him . But we cannot love God if we sin gravely against him,
against our neighbor or against ourselves : "He who does not love
remains in death. Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and
you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him . " 612 Our
Lord warns us that we shall be separated from him if we fail to meet 1 861
the serious needs of the poor and the little ones who are his 393

brethren. 613 To die in mortal sin without repenting and accepting 633
God's merciful love means remaining separated from him for ever

by our own free choice. This state of definitive self-exclusion from
communion with God and the blessed is called "hell."

270
1034

Part One
Jesus often speaks of "Gehenna, " of " the unquenchable

fire" reserved for those who to the end of their lives refuse to
believe and be converted, where both soul and body can be lost. 6 14
Jesus solemnly proclaims that he "will send his angels, and they

will gather . . . all evil doers, and throw them into the fu rnace of
fire," 615 and that he will pronounce the condemnation: "Depart
from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire ! "6 16

1035

The teaching of the Church affi rms the existence of hell and

its e ternity . Immediately after death the souls of those who die in

a s tate of mortal sin descend into hell, where they suffer the
punishments of hell, " eternal fire."617 The chief punishment of hell

393 is e ternal separation from God, in whom alone man can possess the
life and happiness for which he was created and for which he longs .

1036

The affirmations of Sacred Scripture and the teachings of

the Church on the subject of hell are a

call to the responsibility

1 734 incumbent upon man to make use of his freedom in view of his
1 428 eternal des tiny. They are at the same time an urgent call to conver­

sion:

"Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is

easy, that leads to des truction, and those who enter by it are many.
For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life, and
those who find it are few . " 618
Since we know neither the day nor the hour, we should
follow the advice of the Lord and watch constantly so that,
when the single course of our earthly life is completed, we
may merit to enter with him into the marriage feast and be
numbered among the blessed, and not, like the wicked and
slothful servants, be ordered to depart into the eternal fire,
into the outer darkness where "men will weep and gnash
their teeth." 619

1037

God predestines no one to go to hell; 620 for this, a willful

1 62 turning away from God (a mortal sin) is necessary, and persistence
1 0 1 4, 1 82 1 in it until the end . In the Eucharistic li turgy and in the daily prayers
of her faithful, the Church implores the mercy of God, who does
not want "any to perish, but all to come to repentance": 621

THE LAST JuDGMENT

1038

The resurrection of all the dead, "of both the just and the

unjust," 623 will precede the Last Judgment. This will be "the hour

1 001, 998

when all who are in the tombs will hear [the Son of man's] voice
and come forth, those who have done good, to the resurrection of
life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment. "624 Then Christ will come "in his glory, and all the angels
with him . . . . Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he

will separate them one from another as a shepherd separates the

sheep from the goats, and he will place the sheep at his right hand,

but the goats at the left. . . . And they will go away into eternal
punishment, but the righteous into etemal life . "625

1039

In

the presence of Christ, who is Truth itself, the truth of

each man's relationship with God will be laid bare. 626 The Last
Judgment will reveal even to its furthest consequences the good
each person has done or failed to do during his earthly life:
All that the wicked do is recorded, and they do not know .
When "our God comes, he does not keep silence." . . . he will
turn towards those at his left hand: . . . "I placed my poor
little ones on earth for you. I as their head was seated in
heaven at the right hand of my Father - but on earth my
members were suffering, my members on earth were in
need. If you gave anything to my members, what you gave
would reach their Head. Would that you had known that
my little ones were in need when I placed them on earth for
you and appointed them your stewards to bring your good
works into my treasury. But you have placed nothing in their
hands; therefore you have found nothing in my presence." 627

Part

One

The Last Judgment will come when Christ returns in glory.

Only the Fa ther knows the day and the hour; only he determines

637 the moment of its coming. Then through his Son Jesus Christ he
will pronounce the final word on all history. We shall know the
ultima te meaning of the whole work of creation and of the entire
economy of salva tion and unders tand the marvellous ways by

3 1 4 which his Providence led everything towards its final end . The Last
Judgment will reveal that God's justice triumphs over all the
injustices committed by his creatures and that God's love is

stronger than death. 628

1041

The message of the Last Judgment calls men to conversion

while God is still giving them " the acceptable time, . . . the day of
1 432 salvation. "629 It inspires a holy fear of God and commits them to
the justice of the Kingdom of God. It proclaims the "blessed hope"

of the Lord 's return, when he will come " to be glorified in his saints,
and to be marvelled at in all who have believe." 630

1042

THE HOPE OF THE NEW HEAVEN AND THE NEW EARTH
At the end of time, the Kingdom of God will come in its

fullness . After the universal judgment, the righteous will reign for

769 ever with Christ, glorified in body and soul . The universe itself will
670 be renewed:
The Church . . . will receive her perfection only in the glory
of heaven, when will come the time of the renewal of all
things. A t that time, together with the human race, the
universe itself, which is so closely related to man and which
attains its destiny through him, will be perfectly re-estab­
63
lished in Christ. 1

310

1043

Sacred Scripture calls this mys terious renewal, which will

transform humanity and the world, "new heavens and a new
earth." 632 It will be the definitive realization of God's plan to bring

671
280, 51 8 under a single head "all things in [Christ], things in heaven and

from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be
mourning nor crying nor pain any more, for the former things have
passed away." 635

1045

For man,

this consummation will be the final realization of

the unity of the human race, which God willed from creation and
of which the pilgrim Church has been "in the nature of sacra-

775

nity of the redeemed,

1 404

ment." 636 Those who are united with Christ will form the commu-

"the holy city" of God, " the Bride, the wife

of the Lamb." 637 She will not be wounded any longer by sin, stains,
self-love, that destroy or wound the earthly community. 638 The
beatific vision, in which God opens himself in an inexhaustible way
to the elect, will be the ever-flowing well-spring of happiness,
peace, and mutual communion.

1046

For the cosmos,

Revelation affirms the profound common

destiny of the material world and man:
For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing
of the sons of God . . . in hope because the creation itself will
be set free from its bondage to decay. . . . We know that the
whole creation has been groaning in travail together until
now; and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have
the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait for
639
adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.

1047

349

The visible universe, then, is itself destined to be trans­

formed, "so that the world itself, restored to its original state, facing
no further obstacles, should be at the service of the just," sharing
their glorification in the risen Jesus Christ. 64 0

"We know neither the moment of the consummation of the earth

and of man, nor the way in which the universe will be transformed .

in which righteousness dwells, in which happiness will fill and
surpass all the desires of peace arising in the hearts of men." 64 1

the body of a new human family grows, foreshadowing in some
way the age which is to come. That is why, although we must be
careful to distinguish earthly progress clearly from the increase of

2820 the kingdom of Christ, such progress is of vital concern to the
kingdom of God, insofar as it can contribute to the better ordering
of human society."642

1 709 in his Spirit, we will find them once again, cleansed this time from

260 to his Father an eternal and universal kingdom. "643 God will then
be "all in all" in eternal life: 644

True and subsistent life consists in this: the Father, through
the Son and in the Holy Spirit, pouring out his heavenly gifts
on all things without exception. Thanks to his mercy, we too,
men that we are, have received the inalienable promise of
eternal life. 645

1051

Every man receives his eternal recompense in his im­

dead.

"We believe that the souls of all who die in Christ's

grace . . . are the People of God beyond death. On the
day of resurrection, death will be definitively con­
quered, when these souls will be reunited with their
bodies" (Paul VI,

1053

"We b elieve that the multitude of those gathered

(Paul VI,

1054

CPG § 29) .

Those who die in God's grace and friendship imper­
fectly purified, although they are assured of their eter­
nal salvation, undergo a purification after death, so as
to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of
God .

1055

By virtue of the "communion of saints," the Church
commends the dead to God's mercy and offers her
prayers, especially the holy sacrifice of the Eucharist,
on their behalf.

1056

Following the example of Christ, the Church warns the
faithful of the "sad and lamentable reality of e ternal
death"

1057

(GCD 69), also called

"hell."

Hell's principal punishment consists of e ternal sepa­
ration from God in whom alone man can have the life
and happiness for which he was created and for which
he longs.

1058

The Church prays that no one should be lost: "Lord,
let me never be parted from you ." If it is true that no
one can save himself, it is also true that God "desires
all men to be saved"
things are possible"

1059

"The holy Roman Church firmly believes and con­
fesses that on the Day of Judgment all men will appear
in their own bodies before Christ's tribunal to render

an account of their own deeds" (Council of Lyons II

[1274] : DS 859; cf. DS 1549).
1060

At the end of time, the Kingdom of God will come in
its fullness. Then the just will reign with Christ for
ever, glorified in body and soul, and the material

universe itself will be transformed. God will then be
"all in all"

(1 Cor 15:28), in eternal life.

276

Part One

"AMEN"

1061

The Creed, like the last book of the Bible, 646 ends with the

Hebrew word amen . This word frequently concludes prayers in the

2856 New Testament. The Church likewise ends her prayers with
"Amen."

1062

In Hebrew, amen comes from the same root as the word

"believe." This root expresses solidity, trustworthiness, faithful-

2 1 4 ness . And so we can understand why " Amen" may express both
God's faithfulness towards us and our trust in him.

1063

In the book of the prophet Isaiah, we find the expression

"God of truth" (literally "God of the Amen"), that is, the God who

2 1 5 is faithful to his promises: "He who blesses himself in the land shall
bless himself by the God of truth [amen] . " 647 Our Lord often used
156 the word " Amen," sometimes repeated, 648 to emphasize the trust­
worthiness of his teaching, his authori ty founded on God's truth .

1064

Thus the Creed's final "Amen" repeats and confirms its

first words: "I believe . " To believe is to say "Amen" to God's

197, 2 1 01 words, promises and commandments; to entrust oneself com­
pletely to him who is the "Amen" of infinite love and perfect
faithfulness . The Christian's everyday life will then be the " Amen"
to the "I believe" of our bap tismal profession of faith:
May your Creed be for you as a mirror. Look at yourself in
it, to see if you believe everyth
you say you believe. And
64
rejoice in your faith each day.

in�

1065

Jesus Christ himself is the " Amen . " 650 He is the definitive

"Amen" of the Father's love for us. He takes up and completes our
"Amen" to the Father: "For all the promises of God find their Yes
in him. That is why we u tter the Amen through him, to the glory
of God" : 651
Through him, with him, in him,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
all glory and honor is yours,
almighty Father,
God, for ever and ever.

The scene depicts the encounter of Jesus with the woman with the hemorrhage.
This woman who had suffered for many years was healed by touching the cloak
of Jesus through the power that "had gone forth from him" (cf. Mk 5:25-34).
The sacraments of the Church now continue the works which Christ had per­
formed during his earthly life (cf. § 1 1 15). The sacraments are as it were "powers
that go forth" from the Body of Christ to heal the wounds of sin and to give us
the new life of Christ (d. §11 16).
This image thus symbolizes the divine and saving power of the Son of God who
heals the whole man, soul and body, through the sacramental life.

PART TWO
THE CELEBRATION
OF THE CHRISTIAN
MYSTERY
Why the liturgy?

1066
In the Symbol of the faith the Church confesses the mystery
of the Holy Trinity and of the plan of God's "good pleasure" for all
creation: the Father accomplishes the "mystery of his will" by 50
giving his beloved Son and his Holy Spirit for the salvation of the
world and for the glory of his name. 1 Such is the mystery of Christ,
revealed and fulfilled in history according to the wisely ordered
plan that St. Paul calls the "plan of the mystery" 2 and the patristic 236
tradition will call the "economy of the Word incarnate" or the
"economy of salvation."
1067
"The wonderful works of God among the people of the
Old Testament were but a prelude to the work of Christ the Lord
in redeeming mankind and giving perfect glory to God. He accom­
plished this work principally by the Paschal mystery of his blessed
Passion, Resurrection from the dead, and glorious Ascension,
whereby 'dying he destroyed our death, rising he restored our life.'
For it was from the side of Christ as he slept the sleep of death upon
the cross that there came forth 'the wondrous sacrament of the
whole Church."' 3 For this reason, the Church celebrates in the
liturgy above all the Paschal mystery by which Christ accomplished the work of our salvation.

1068
It is this mystery of Christ that the Church proclaims and
celebrates in her liturgy so that the faithful may live from it and
bear witness to it in the world:

Part Two
For it is in the liturgy, especially in the divine sacrifice of the
Eucharist, that "the work of our redemption is accom­
plished," and it is through the liturgy especially that the
faithful are enabled to express in their lives and manifest to
others the mystery of Christ and the real nature of the true
Church. 4

What does the word liturgy mean?

1069
The word "liturgy" originally meant a "public work" or a
"service in the name of/ on behalf of the people." In Christian
tradition it means the participation of the People of God in "the
work of God."5 Through the liturgy Christ, our redeemer and high
priest, continues the work of our redemption in, with, and through
his Church.
1070
In the New Testament the word "liturgy" refers not only
to the celebration of divine worship but also to the proclamation
of the Gospel and to active charity. 6 In all of these situations it is a
question of the service of God and neighbor. In a liturgical celebra­
tion the Church is servant in the image of her Lord, the one
783 "leitourgos";? she shares in Christ's priesthood (worship), which is
both prophetic (proclamation) and kingly (service of charity):
The liturgy then is rightly seen as an exercise of the priestly
office of Jesus Christ. It involves the presentation of man's
sanctification under the guise of signs perceptible by the
senses and its accomplishment in ways appropriate to each
of these signs. In it full public worship is performed by the
Mystical Body of Jesus Christ, that is, by the Head and his
members. From this it follows that every liturgical celebra­
tion, because it is an action of Christ the priest and of his
Body which is the Church, is a sacred action surpassing all
others. No other action of the Church can equal its efficacy
by the same title and to the same degree. 8

Liturgy as source of life

1071
As the work of Christ liturgy is also an action of his Church.
It makes the Church present and manifests her as the visible sign
of the communion in Christ between God and men. It engages the
faithful in the new life of the community and involves the "con1 692 scious, active, and fruitful participation" of everyone. 9

"The sacred liturgy does not exhaust the entire activity of
1072
the Church" : 10 it must be preceded by evangelization, faith, and
conversion. It can then produce its fruits in the lives of the faithful:
new life in the Spirit, involvement in the mission of the Church,
and service to her unity.
Prayer and liturgy

1073
The liturgy is also a participation in Christ's own prayer
addressed to the Father in the Holy Spirit. In the liturgy, all Chris­
tian prayer finds its source and goal. Through the liturgy the inner
man is rooted and grounded in "the great love with which [the
Father] loved us" in his beloved Son.l 1 It is the same "marvelous
work of God" that is lived and internalized by all prayer, "at all
2558
times in the Spirit." 1 2
Catechesis and liturgy

1074
"The liturgy is the summit toward which the activity of the
Church is directed; it is also the font from which all her power
flows ."1 3 It is therefore the privileged place for catechizing the
People of God. "Catechesis is intrinsically linked with the whole of
liturgical and sacramental activity, for it is in the sacraments,
especially in the Eucharist, that Christ Jesus works in fullness for
the transformation of men." 14
1075
Liturgical catechesis aims to initiate people into the mys- 426
tery of Christ (It is "mystagogy.") by proceeding from the visible
to the invisible, from the sign to the thing signified, from the
"sacraments" to the "mysteries." Such catechesis is to be presented 774
by local and regional catechisms. This Catechism, which aims to
serve the whole Church in all the diversity of her rites and cul­
tures,lS will present what is fundamental and common to the
whole Church in the liturgy as mystery and as celebration (Section
One), and then the seven sacraments and the sacramentals (Section
Two).

SECTION ONE
THE SACRAMENTAL ECONOMY
1076
The Church was made manifest to the world on the day of
Pentecost by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. 1 The gift of the
Spirit ushers in a new era in the "dispensation of the mystery" ­
the age of the Church, during which Christ manifests, makes
739 present, and communicates his work of salvation through the
liturgy of his Church, "until he comes."2 In this age of the Church
Christ now lives and acts in and with his Church, in a new way
appropriate to this new age. He acts through the sacraments in
what the common Tradition of the East and the West calls "the
sacramental economy"; this is the communication (or "dispensa­
tion") of the fruits of Christ's Paschal mystery in the celebration of
the Church's "sacramental" liturgy.
It is therefore important first to explain this "sacramental
dispensation" (chapter one). The nature and essential features of
liturgical celebration will then appear more clearly (chapter two).

THE FATHER - SOURCE AND GOAL OF THE LITURGY

1077
"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the
492 heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation
of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. He
destined us before him in love to be his sons through Jesus Christ,
according to the purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious
grace which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved."3
2626 1078
Blessing is a divine and life-giving action, the source of
which is the Father; his blessing is both word and gift. 4 When

applied to man, the word "blessing" means adoration and surren­
der to his Creator in thanksgiving.
1079
From the beginning until the end of time the whole of
God's work is a blessing. From the liturgical poem of the first
creation to the canticles of the heavenly Jerusalem, the inspired
authors proclaim the plan of salvation as one vast divine blessing.
1080
From the very beginning God blessed all living beings,
especially man and woman. The covenant with Noah and with all
living things renewed this blessing of fruitfulness despite man's
sin which had brought a curse on the ground. But with Abraham,
the divine blessing entered into human history which was moving
toward death, to redirect it toward life, toward its source. By the
faith of "the father of all believers," who embraced the blessing, the
history of salvation is inaugurated.
1081
The divine blessings were made manifest in astonishing
and saving events: the birth of Isaac, the escape from Egypt (Pass­
over and Exodus), the gift of the promised land, the election of
David, the presence of God in the Temple, the purifying exile, and
return of a "small remnant." The Law, the Prophets, and the
Psalms, interwoven in the liturgy of the Chosen People, recall these
divine blessings and at the same time respond to them with bless­
ings of praise and thanksgiving.
1082
In the Church's liturgy the divine blessing is fully revealed
and communicated. The Father is acknowledged and adored as the
source and the end of all the blessings of creation and salvation. In
his Word who became incarnate, died, and rose for us, he fills us
with his blessings . Through his Word, he pours into our hearts the
Gift that contains all gifts, the Holy Spirit.
1083
The dual dimension of the Christian liturgy as a response of 2627
faith and love to the spiritual blessings the Father bestows on us is thus
evident. On the one hand, the Church, united with her Lord and "in the
Holy Spirit,''5 blesses the Father "for his inexpressible gift"6 in her
adoration, praise, and thanksgiving. On the other hand, until the con­
summation of God's plan, the Church never ceases to present to the
Father the offering of his own gifts and to beg him to send the Holy Spirit 1360
upon that offering, upon herself, upon the faithful, and upon the whole
world, so that through communion in the death and resurrection of
Christ the Priest, and by the power of the Spirit, these divine blessings
will bring forth the fruits of life "to the praise of his glorious grace." 7

Chri s t g lo ri f ied .

"Seated at the right hand of the Father" and pouring out the
Holy Spirit on his Body which is the Church, Christ now acts through
the sacraments he instituted to communicate his grace. The sacra1 12 7 ments are perceptible signs (words and actions) accessible to our
human nature. By the action of Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit
they make present efficaciously the grace that they signify.

1085
In the liturgy of the Church, it is principally his own
Paschal mystery that Christ signifies and makes present. During
his earthly life Jesus announced his Paschal mystery by his teaching
and anticipated it by his actions. When his Hour comes, he lives
out the unique event of history which does not pass away: Jesus
dies, is buried, rises from the dead, and is seated at the right hand
of the Father " once for all.''s His Paschal mystery is a real event that
occurred in our history, but it is unique: all other historical events
happen once, and then they pass away, swallowed up in the past.
The Paschal mystery of Christ, by contrast, cannot remain only in
51 9 the past, because by his death he destroyed death, and all that
Christ is - all that he did and suffered for all men - participates in
the divine eternity, and so transcends all times while being made
1 1 65 present in them all. The event of the Cross and Resurrection abides
and draws everything toward life .
. . . from the time of the Church of the Apostles . . .
858 1086
"Accordingly, just as Christ was sent by the Father so also
he sent the apostles, filled with the Holy Spirit. This he did so that
they might preach the Gospel to every creature and proclaim that
the Son of God by his death and resurrection had freed us from the
power of Satan and from death and brought us into the Kingdom
of his Father. But he also willed that the work of salvation which
they preached should be set in train through the sacrifice and
sacraments, around which the entire liturgical life revolves."9

1087
Thus the risen Christ, by giving the Holy Spirit to the
apostles, entrusted to them his power of sanctifying: 10 they
b ecame sacramental signs of Christ. By the power of the same
861 Holy Spirit they entrusted this power to their successors. This

1088
"To accomplish so great a work" - the dispensation or com­
munication of his work of salvation - "Christ is always present in his
Church, especially in her liturgical celebrations. He is present in the 776
Sacrifice of the Mass not only in the person of his minister, 'the same 669
now offering, through the ministry of priests, who formerly offered
himself on the cross,' but especially in the Eucharistic species. By his
power he is present in the sacraments so that when anybody baptizes, 1 3 73
it is really Christ himself who baptizes. He is present in his word since
it is he himself who speaks when the holy Scriptures are read in the
Church. Lastly, he is present when the Church prays and sings, for he
has promised 'where two or three are gathered together in my name
there am I in the midst of them. "' ll
1089
"Christ, indeed, always associates the Church with himself
in this great work in which God is perfectly glorified and men are
sanctified. The Church is his beloved Bride who calls to her Lord 796
and through him offers worship to the eternal Father." 12

"In the earthly liturgy we share in a foretaste of that 1 1 37-1139
heavenly liturgy which is celebrated in the Holy City of Jerusalem
toward which we journey as pilgrims, where Christ is sitting at the
right hand of God, Minister of the sanctuary and of the true
tabernacle. With all the warriors of the heavenly army we sing a
hymn of glory to the Lord; venerating the memory of the saints, we
hope for some part and fellowship with them; we eagerly await the
Savior, our Lord Jesus Christ, until he, our life, shall appear and we
too will appear with him in glory." 13

THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE CHURCH IN THE LITURGY

1091
In the liturgy the Holy Spirit is teacher of the faith of the
People of God and artisan of "God's masterpieces," the sacraments
of the New Covenant. The desire and work of the Spirit in the heart 798

12 sc 7.
13 SC 8; d. LG 50.

284

Part Two

of the Church is that we may live from the life of the risen Christ.
When the Spirit encounters in us the response of faith which he has
aroused in us, he brings about genuine cooperation. Through it, the
liturgy becomes the common work of the Holy Spirit and the Church.
1092
In this sacramental dispensation of Christ's mystery the
Holy Spirit acts in the same way as at other times in the economy
737 of salvation: he prepares the Church to encounter her Lord; he
recalls and makes Christ manifest to the faith of the assembly. By
his transforming power, he makes the mystery of Christ present
here and now. Finally the Spirit of communion unites the Church
to the life and mission of Christ.
The Holy Spirit prepares for the reception of Christ

1093
In the sacramental economy the Holy Spirit fulfills what
was prefigured in the Old Covenant. Since Christ's Church was
762 "prepared in marvellous fashion in the history of the people of
Israel and in the Old Covenant," 14 the Church's liturgy has re­
tained certain elements of the worship of the Old Covenant as
integral and irreplaceable, adopting them as her own:
121 -notably, reading the Old Testament;
2585 -praying the Psalms;
1 081 -above all, recalling the saving events and significant realities which

have found their fulfillment in the mystery of Christ (promise and
covenant, Exodus and Passover, kingdom and temple, exile and return).

It is on this harmony of the two Testaments that the Paschal
catechesis of the Lord is built, 15 and then, that of the Apostles and the
Fathers of the Church. This catechesis unveils what lay hidden under
the letter of the Old Testament: the mystery of Christ. It is called
"typological" because it reveals the newness of Christ on the basis of
the "figures" (types) which announce him in the deeds, words, and
symbols of the first covenant. By this re-reading in the Spirit of Truth,
starting from Christ, the figures are unveiled. 16 Thus the flood and
Noah's ark prefigured salvation by BaptismP as did the cloud and
the crossing of the Red Sea. Water from the rock was the figure of the
spiritual gifts of Christ, and manna in the desert prefigured the
Eucharist, "the true bread from heaven." 18

285

1095
For this reason the Church, especially during Advent and
Lent and above all at the Easter Vigil, re-reads and re-lives the great
events of salvation history in the "today" of her liturgy. But this 281
also demands that catechesis help the faithful to open themselves
to this spiritual understanding of the economy of salvation as the 1 1 7
Church's liturgy reveals it and enables u s to live it.
1096
Jewish liturgy and Christian liturgy. A better knowledge of the
Jewish people's faith and religious life as professed and lived even now
can help our better understanding of certain aspects of Christian li turgy.
For both Jews and Christians Sacred Scripture is an essential part of their
respective liturgies: in the proclamation of the Word of God, the response
to this word, prayer of praise and intercession for the living and the dead,
invocation of God's mercy. In its characteristic structure the Liturgy of the
Word originates in Jewish prayer. The Liturgy of the Hours and other
liturgical texts and formularies, as well as those of our most venerable
prayers, including the Lord's Prayer, have parallels in Jewish prayer. The
Eucharistic Prayers also d raw their inspiration from the Jewish tradition.
The relationship between Jewish liturgy and Christian liturgy, but also their
differences in content, are particularly evident in the great feasts of the
liturgical year, such as Passover. Christians and Jews both celebrate the
Passover. For Jews, it is the Passover of history, tending toward the future; for
Christians, it is the Passover fulfilled in the death and Resurrection of Christ,
though always in expectation of its definitive consummation.

1 1 74
1 352

1097
In the liturgy of the New Covenant every liturgical action,
especially the celebration of the Eucharist and the sacraments, is an
encounter between Christ and the Church. The liturgical assembly
derives its unity from the "communion of the Holy Spirit" who
gathers the children of God into the one Body of Christ. This assembly
transcends racial, cultural, social - indeed, all human affinities.
1098
The assembly should prepare itself to encounter its Lord
and to become "a people well disposed." The preparation of hearts
is the joint work of the Holy Spirit and the assembly, especially of
its ministers. The grace of the Holy Spirit seeks to awaken faith,
conversion of heart, and adherence to the Father's will. These 1 430
dispositions are the precondition both for the reception of other
graces conferred in the celebration itself and the fruits of new life
which the celebration is intended to produce afterward.
The Holy Spirit recalls the mystery of Christ

1099

The Spirit and the Church cooperate to manifest Christ and

his work of salvation in the liturgy. Primarily in the Eucharist, and by

analogy in the other sacraments, the liturgy is the memorial of the
mystery of salvation. The Holy Spirit is the Church's living memory.19 91
19 Cf. Jn 14:26.

286
1 1 34 1100

Part Two
The Word of God.

The Holy Spirit first recalls the meaning of

the salvation event to the liturgical assembly by giving life t o the Word
of God, which is proclaimed so that it may be received and lived:
In the celebration of the liturgy, Sacred Scripture is extremely
important. From it come the lessons that are read and ex­
plained in the homily and the psalms that are sung. It is from
the Scriptures that the prayers, collects, and hymns draw
their inspiration and their force, and that actions and signs
derive their meaning.20

1 03, 131

1 1 7 1101

The Holy Spirit gives a spiritual understanding of the

Word of God to those who read or hear it, according to the dispo­
sitions of their hearts . By means of the words, actions, and symbols
that form the structure of a celebration, the Spirit puts both the
faithful and the ministers into a living relationship with Christ, the
Word and Image of the Father, so that they can live out the meaning
of what they hear, contemplate, and do in the celebration.

1102

"By the saving word of God, faith . . . is nourished in the

hearts of believers . By this faith then the congregation of the faithful
begins and grows. " 21 The proclamation does not stop with a teach­
ing; it elicits the

response of faith

as consent and commitment,

1 43 directed at the covenant between God and his people. Once again
it is the Holy Spirit who gives the grace of faith, strengthens it and
makes it grow in the community. The liturgical assembly is first of
all a communion in faith.

1 3 62 1103

Anamnesis. The liturgical celebration always refers to God's

saving interventions in history. "The economy of Revelation is real­
ized by deeds and words which are intrinsically bound up with each
other. . . . [T]he words for their part proclaim the works and bring to
light the mystery they contain."22 In the Uturgy of the Word the Holy
Spirit "recalls" to the assembly all that Christ has done for us.

In

keeping with the nature of liturgical actions and the ritual traditions
of the churches, the celebration "makes a remembrance" of the mar­
velous works of God in an anamnesis which may be more or less
developed. The Holy Spirit who thus awakens the memory of the
Church then inspires thanksgiving and praise

(doxology).

The Celebration of the Christian Mystery

287

The Holy Spirit makes present the mystery of Christ

1104

Christian liturgy not only recalls the events that saved us

but actualizes them, makes them present. The Paschal mystery of
Christ is celebrated, not repeated. It is the celebrations that are

1 085

repeated, and in each celebration there is an outpouring of the Holy
Spirit that makes the unique mystery present.

1105

The

Epiclesis

("invocation upon") is the intercession in

which the priest begs the Father to send the Holy Spirit, the
Sanctifier, so that the offerings may become the body and blood of

1 1 53

Christ and that the faithful, by receiving them, may themselves
become a living offering to God. 23

1106

Together with the anamnesis, the epiclesis is at the heart

of each sacramental celebration, most especially of the Eucharist:

You ask how the bread becomes the Body of Christ, and the
wine . . . the Blood of Christ. I shall tell you: the Holy Spirit comes
upon them and accomplishes what surpasses every word and
thought. . . . Let it be enough for you to understand that it is by
the Holy Spirit, just as it was of the Holy Virgin and by the Holy
Spirit that the Lord, through and in himself, took flesh.24

1107

1375

The Holy Spirit's transforming power in the liturgy has-

tens the coming of the kingdom and the consummation of the
mystery of salvation. While we wait in hope he causes us really to
anticipate the fullness of communion with the Holy Trinity. Sent

2816

by the Father who hears the epiclesis of the Church, the Spirit gives
life to those who accept him and is, even now, the "guarantee " of
their inheritance.25

The communion of the Holy Spirit

1108

In every liturgical action the Holy Spirit is sent in order to

bring us into communion with Christ and so to form his Body. The
Holy Spirit is like the sap of the Father's vine which bears fruit on
its branches.2 6 The most intimate cooperation of the Holy Spirit

788
1 091

and the Church is achieved in the liturgy. The Spirit, who is the
Spirit of communion, abides indefectibly in the Church . For this
reason the Church is the great sacrament of divine communion
which gathers God's scattered children together. Communion with

288

Part Two

the Holy Trinity and fraternal communion are inseparably the fruit
of the Spirit in the liturgy.27
1109
The epiclesis is also a prayer for the full effect of the
assembly's communion with the mystery of Christ. "The grace of
the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the
Holy Spirit"2 8 have to remain with us always and bear fruit beyond
the Eucharistic celebration. The Church therefore asks the Father
to send the Holy Spirit to make the lives of the faithful a living
1 368 sacrifice to God by their spiritual transformation into the image of
Christ, by concern for the Church's unity, and by taking part in her
mission through the witness and service of charity.

IN B RIEF
1110

In the liturgy of the Church, God the Father is blessed
and adored as the source of all the blessings of creation
and salvation with which he has blessed us in his Son,
in order to give us the Spirit of filial adoption.

1111

Christ's work in the liturgy is sacramental: because his
mystery of salvation is made present there by the
power of his Holy Spirit; because his Body, which is
the Church, is like a sacrament (sign and instrument)
in which the Holy Spirit dispenses the mystery of
salvation; and because through her liturgical actions
the pilgrim Church already participates, as by a fore­
taste, in the heavenly liturgy.

1112

The mission of the Holy Spirit in the liturgy of the
Church is to prepare the assembly to encounter Christ;
to recall and manifest Christ to the faith of the assem­
bly; to make the saving work of Christ present and
active by his transforming power; and to make the gift
of communion bear fruit in the Church.

ARTICLE 2

THE PAS CHAL MYSTERY IN THE CHURCH'S
SACRAMENTS

1113
The whole liturgical life of the Church revolves aronnd the 1210
Eucharistic sacrifice and the sacraments.29 There are seven sacraments
in the Church: Baptism, Confirmation or Chrismation, Eucharist,
Penance, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, and Matrimony.30 This
article will discuss what is common to the Church's seven sacraments
from a doctrinal point of view. What is common to them in terms of
their celebration will be presented in the second chapter, and what is
distinctive about each will be the topic of the Section Two.
THE SACRAMENTS OF CHRIST

I.

1114
"Adhering to the teaching of the Holy Scriptures, to the
apostolic traditions, and to the consensus . . . of the Fathers," we
profess that "the sacraments of the new law were . . . all instituted
by Jesus Christ our Lord."31
1115
Jesus' words and actions during his hidden life and public
ministry were already salvific, for they anticipated the power of his
Paschal mystery. They annonnced and prepared what he was going
to give the Church when all was accomplished. The mysteries of 512-560
Christ's life are the fonndations of what he would henceforth dispense
in the sacraments, through the ministers of his Church, for "what was
visible in our Savior has passed over into his mysteries."32
1116
Sacraments are "powers that comes forth" from the Body 1 504
of Christ,33 which is ever-living and life-giving. They are actions of 774
the Holy Spirit at work in his Body, the Church. They are "the
masterworks of God" in the new and everlasting covenant.

THE SACRAMENTS OF THE CHURCH

As she has done for the canon of Sacred Scripture and for 1 20
the doctrine of the faith, the Church, by the power of the Spirit who
guides her "into all truth," has gradually recognized this treasure

received from Christ and, as the faithful steward of God's myster­
ies, has determined its "dispensation."34 Thus the Church has
discerned over the centuries that among liturgical celebrations
there are seven that are, in the strict sense of the term, sacraments
instituted by the Lord.
1118
The sacraments are "of the Church" in the double sense
that they are ''by her" and "for her." They are "by the Church," for
she is the sacrament of Christ's action at work in her through the
1 396 mission of the Holy Spirit. They are "for the Church" in the sense
that "the sacraments make the Church,"35 since they manifest and
communicate to men, above all in the Eucharist, the mystery of
communion with the God who is love, One in three persons.

Forming "as it were, one mystical person" with Christ the
head, the Church acts in the sacraments as "an organically structured
priestly community."36 Through Baptism and Confirmation the
priestly people is enabled to celebrate the liturgy, while those of the
faithful "who have received Holy Orders, are appointed to nourish
the Church with the word and grace of God in the name of Christ."37

The ordained ministry or ministerial priesthood is at the
service of the baptismal priesthood.38 The ordained priesthood
guarantees that it really is Christ who acts in the sacraments
through the Holy Spirit for the Church. The saving mission en­
trusted by the Father to his incarnate Son was committed to the
apostles and through them to their successors: they receive the
Spirit of Jesus to act in his name and in his person.39 The ordained
minister is the sacramental bond that ties the liturgical action to
what the apostles said and did and, through them, to the words
and actions of Christ, the source and foundation of the sacraments.

1121
The three sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and Holy
Orders confer, in addition to grace, a sacramental character or "seal"
1 2 72, 1 304, by which the Christian shares in Christ's priesthood and is made
1 582 a member of the Church according to different states and functions.

the Spirit, is indelible;4 0 it remains for ever in the Christian as a

positive disposition for grace, a promise and guarantee of divine
protection, and as a vocation to divine worship and to the service
of the Church. Therefore these sacraments can never be repeated.
Ill.

THE SACRAMENTS OF FAITH

1122
Christ sent his apostles so that "repentance and forgive­
ness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations."4 1 "Go
therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the
name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." 42 The
mission to baptize, and so the sacramental mission, is implied in
the mission to evangelize, because the sacrament is prepared for 849
by the word of God and by the faith which is assent to this word:
1 236
The People of God is formed into one in the first place by the
Word of the living God . . . . The preaching of the Word is
required for the sacramental ministry itself, since the sacraments are sacraments of faith, drawing their origin and
nourishment from the Word.43

1123
"The purpose of the sacraments is to sanctify men, to build
up the Body of Christ and, finally, to give worship to God. Because
they are signs they also instruct. They not only presuppose faith,
but by words and objects they also nourish, strengthen, and ex- 1 154
press it. That is why they are called 'sacraments offaith."'44
1124
The Church's faith precedes the faith of the believer who 1 66
is invited to adhere to it. When the Church celebrates the sacra­
ments, she confesses the faith received from the apostles - whence
the ancient saying: lex orandi, lex credendi (or: legem credendi lex 1 327
statuat supplicandi, according to Prosper of Aquitaine [5th cent.]).45
The law of prayer is the law of faith: the Church believes as she 78
prays. Liturgy is a constitutive element of the holy and living
Tradition.46
1125
For this reason no sacramental rite may be modified or 1 205
manipulated at the will of the minister or the community. Even the
supreme authority in the Church may not change the liturgy
arbitrarily, but only in the obedience of faith and with religious
respect for the mystery of the liturgy.

Likewise, since the sacraments express and develop the com­
munion of faith in the Church, the lex orandi is one of the essential
815 criteria of the dialogue that seeks to restore the unity of Christians.47
IV.

THE SACRAMENTS OF SALVATION

Celebrated worthily in faith, the sacraments confer the
1127
grace that they signify. 48 They are efficacious because in them Christ
1 084 himself is at work: it is he who baptizes, he who acts in his
sacraments in order to communicate the grace that each sacrament
signifies. The Father always hears the prayer of his Son's Church
1 1 05 which, in the epiclesis of each sacrament, expresses her faith in the
696 power of the Spirit. As fire transforms into itself everything it
touches, so the Holy Spirit transforms into the divine life whatever
is subjected to his power.
1128
This is the meaning of the Church's affirrn ation49 that the
sacraments act ex opere operata (literally: "by the very fact of the
action's being performed"), i.e., by virtue of the saving work of
Christ, accomplished once for all. It follows that "the sacrament is
not wrought by the righteousness of either the celebrant or the
1 584 recipient, but by the power of God."5° From the moment that a
sacrament is celebrated in accordance with the intention of the
Church, the power of Christ and his Spirit acts in and through it,
independently of the personal holiness of the minister. Neverthe­
less, the fruits of the sacraments also depend on the disposition of
the one who receives them.
1 257 1129
The Church affirms that for believers the sacraments of the
2003 New Covenant are necessaryfor salvation.5 1 "Sacramental grace" is the

grace of the Holy Spirit, given by Christ and proper to each sacrament.
The Spirit heals and transforms those who receive him by conforming
460 them to the Son of God. The fruit of the sacramental life is that the
Spirit of adoption makes the faithful partakers in the divine nature52
by uniting them in a living union with the only Son, the Savior.

The Celebration of the Christian Mystery

apostolic age the liturgy has been drawn toward its goal by the
Spirit's groaning in the Church: Marana tha! 54 The liturgy thus
shares in Jesus' desire: "I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover
with you . . . until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God."55 In the 281 7
sacraments of Christ the Church already receives the guarantee of
her inheritance and even now shares in everlasting life, while
"awaiting our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great
God and Savior Christ Jesus."56 The "Spirit and the Bride say,
'Come . . . Come, Lord Jesus!'"57
950
St. Thomas sums up the various aspects of sacramental signs:
"Therefore a sacrament is a sign that commemorates what
precedes it - Christ's Passion; demonstrates what is accom­
plished in us through Christ's Passion - grace; and refig­
ures what that Passion pledges to us - future glory." 8

E

IN BRIEF
1131

The sacraments are efficacious signs of grace, instituted
by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine
life is dispensed to us. The visible rites by which the
sacraments are celebrated signify and make present the
graces proper to each sacrament. They bear fruit in those
who receive them with the required dispositions.

1132

The Church celebrates the sacraments as a priestly
community structured by the baptismal priesthood
and the priesthood of ordained ministers.

1133

The Holy Spirit prepares the faithful for the sacra­
ments by the Word of God and the faith which wel­
comes that word in well-disposed hearts. Thus the
sacraments strengthen faith and express it.

1134

The fruit of sacramental life is both personal and ecclesial.
For every one of the faithful on the one hand, this fruit is
life for God in Christ Jesus; for the Church, on the other, it
is an increase in charity and in her mission of witness.

THE SACRAMENTAL C ELEBRATION
OF THE PASCHAL MYSTERY

1135
The catechesis of the liturgy entails first of all an under­
standing of the sacramental economy (Chapter One). In this light,
the innovation of its celebration is revealed. This chapter will there­
fore treat of the celebration of the sacraments of the Church. It will
consider that which, through the diversity of liturgical traditions,
is common to the celebration of the seven sacraments. What is
proper to each will be treated later. This fundamental catechesis on
the sacramental celebrations responds to the first questions posed
by the faithful regarding this subject:

- Who celebrates the liturgy?
- How is the liturgy celebrated?
- When is the liturgy celebrated?
- Where is the liturgy celebrated?

WHO CELEBRATES?

Liturgy is an "action" of the whole Christ (Christus totus).

heavenly liturgy, where celebration is wholly communion and feast.

1137
The book of Revelation of St. John, read in the Church's
liturgy, first reveals to us, "A throne stood in heaven, with one
seated on the throne": "the Lord God." 1 It then shows the Lamb,
"standing, as though it had been slain": Christ crucified and risen,
the one high priest of the true sanctuary, the same one "who offers
662 and is offered, who gives and is given."2 Finally it presents "the
river of the water of life . . . flowing from the throne of God and of
the Lamb," one of most beautiful symbols of the Holy Spirit. 3

"Recapitulated in Chris t," these are the ones who take part

in the service of the praise of God and the fulfillment of his plan:
the heavenly powers, all creation (the four living beings), the 335
servants of the Old and New Covenants (the twenty-four elders),
the new People of God (the one hundred and forty-four thousand),4
especially the martyrs "slain for the word of God," and the all-holy
Mother of God (the Woman), the Bride of the Lamb,5 and finally 1370
"a great multitude which no one could number, from every nation,

from all tribes, and peoples and tongues ." 6

1139

It is in this eternal liturgy that the Spirit and the Church

enable us to participate whenever we celebrate the mystery of
salvation in the sacraments.

The celebrants of the sacramental liturgy

1140

It is the whole community, the Body of Christ united with its

752, 1348

Head, that celebrates. "Liturgical services are not private functions but

are celebrations of the Church which is 'the sacrament of unity,'

namely, the holy people united and organized under the authority of
the bishops. Therefore, liturgical services pertain to the whole Body

of the Church. They manifest it, and have effects upon it. But they
touch individual members of the Church in different ways, depending
on their orders, their role in the liturgical services, and their actual
participation in them." 7 For this reason, "rites which are meant to be
celebrated in common, with the faithful present and actively partici-

1372

pating, should as far as possible be celebrated in that way rather than
by an individual and quasi-privately." 8

1141

The celebrating assembly is the community of the bap tized

who, "by regeneration and the anointing of the Holy Spirit, are
consecrated to be a spiritual house and a holy priesthood, that

through all the works of Christian men they may offer spiritual
sacrifices ." 9 This "common priesthood" is that of Christ the sole
priest, in which all his members participate : 1 0
Mother Church earnestly desires that all the faithful should
be led to that full, conscious, and active participation in
liturgical celebrations which is demanded by the very nature
of the liturgy, and to which the Christian people, "a chosen

1142
But "the members do not all have the same function." 12
Certain members are called by God, in and through the Church, to
a special service of the community. These servants are chosen and
consecrated by the sacrament of Holy Orders, by which the Holy
Spirit enables them to act in the person of Christ the head, for the
service of all the members of the Church. 13 The ordained minister
1 549 is, as it were, an "icon" of Christ the priest. Since it is in the
Eucharist that the sacrament of the Church is made fully visible, it
is in his presiding at the Eucharist that the bishop's ministry is most
1561 evident, as well as, in communion with him, the ministry of priests
and deacons.
1143
For the purpose of assisting the work of the common
priesthood of the faithful, other particular ministries also exist, not
903 consecrated by the sacrament of Holy Orders; their functions are
determined by the bishops, in accord "Vith liturgical traditions and
pastoral needs. "Servers, readers, commentators, and members of
1 672 the choir also exercise a genuine liturgical function." 14
1144
In the celebration of the sacraments it is thus the whole
assembly that is leitourgos, each according to his function, but in
the "unity of the Spirit" who acts in all. "In liturgical celebrations
each person, minister or layman, who has an office to perform,
should carry out all and only those parts which pertain to his office
by the nature of the rite and the norms of the liturgy." 15
II.

How Is THE L ITURGY CELEBRATED?

1 333-1 340 Signs and symbols

A sacramental celebration is woven from signs and symbols. In keeping with the divine pedagogy of salvation, their mean­
ing is rooted in the work of creation and in human culture,
specified by the events of the Old Covenant and fully revealed in
the person and work of Christ.

The Celebration of the Christian Mystery

297

1146
Signs of the human world. In human life, signs and symbols
occupy an important place. As a being at once body and spirit, man
expresses and perceives spiritual realities through physical signs 362, 2702
and symbols. As a social being, man needs signs and symbols to
communicate with others, through language, gestures, and actions. The same holds true for his relationship with God.
1 879
1147
God speaks to man through the visible creation. The rna- 299
terial cosmos is so presented to man's intelligence that he can read
there traces of its Creator. 16 Light and darkness, wind and fire,
water and earth, the tree and its fruit speak of God and symbolize
both his greatness and his nearness.
1148
Inasmuch as they are creatures, these perceptible realities can
become means of expressing the action of God who sanctifies men,
and the action of men who offer worship to God. The same is true of
signs and symbols taken from the social life of man: washing and
anointing, breaking bread and sharing the cup can express the sanc­
tifying presence of God and man's gratitude toward his Creator.
1149
The great religions of mankind witness, often impres- 843
sively, to this cosmic and symbolic meaning of religious rites. The
liturgy of the Church presupposes, integrates and sanctifies ele­
ments from creation and human culture, conferring on them the
dignity of signs of grace, of the new creation in Jesus Christ.
1150
Signs of the covenant. The Chosen People received from God 1 334
distinctive signs and symbols that marked its liturgical life. These
are no longer solely celebrations of cosmic cycles and social gestures, but signs of the covenant, symbols of God's mighty deeds
for his people. Among these liturgical signs from the Old Covenant
are circumcision, anointing and consecration of kings and priests,
laying on of hands, sacrifices, and above all the Passover. The
Church sees in these signs a prefiguring of the sacraments of the
New Covenant.
1151
Signs taken up by Christ. In his preaching the Lord Jesus 1 335
often makes use of the signs of creation to make known the mysteries of the Kingdom of GodP He performs healings and illustrates his preaching with physical signs or symbolic gestures. 18 He
gives new meaning to the deeds and signs of the Old Covenant,
above all to the Exodus and the Passover,1 9 for he himself is the
meaning of all these signs.

Sacramental signs. Since Pentecost, it is through the sacramen­

tal signs of his Church that the Holy Spirit carries on the work of
sanctification. The sacraments of the Church do not abolish but purify
and integrate all the richness of the signs and symbols of the cosmos
and of social life. Further, they fulfill the types and figures of the Old
Covenant, signify and make actively present the salvation wrought
by Christ, and prefigure and an tidpate the glory of heaven.

Words and actions

1153

A

sacramental celebration is a meeting of God's children

with their Father, in Christ and the Holy Spirit; this meeting takes

53 the form of a dialogue, through actions and words. Admittedly, the
symbolic actions are already a language, but the Word of God and
the response of faith have to accompany and give life to them, so
that the seed of the Kingdom can bear its fruit in good soil. The
liturgical actions signify what the Word of God expresses: both his
free initiative and his people's response of faith.

1 1 00 1154

The

liturgy of the Word

is an integral part of sacramental

celebrations. To nourish the faith of believers, the signs which
accompany the Word of God should be emphasized: the book of

1 03 the Word (a lectionary or a book of the Gospels), its veneration
(p rocession, incense, candles), the place of its proclamation (lectern
or ambo), its audible and intelligible reading, the minister's homily
which extends its proclamation, and the responses of the assembly
(acclamations, meditation psalms, litanies, and profession of faith).

1155

The liturgical word and action are inseparable both insofar

1 1 27 as they are signs and instruction and insofar as they accomplish
what they signify. When the Holy Spirit awakens faith, he not only
gives an understanding of the Word of God, but through the
sacraments also makes present the "wonders" of God which it
proclaims. The Spirit makes present and communicates the Fa­
ther's work, fulfilled by the beloved Son.

Singing and music

1156

"The musical tradition of the universal Church is a treas­

ure of inestimable value, greater even than that of any other art.
The main reason for this pre-eminence is that, as a combination of
sacred music and words, it forms a necessary or integral part of
solemn liturgy." 20 The composition and singing of inspired

19 Cf. Lk 9:31; 22:7-20 .

The Celebration of the Christian Mystery

299

psalms, often accompanied by musical instruments, were already
closely linked to the liturgical celebrations of the Old Covenant.
The Church continues and develops this tradition: "Address . . .
one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and
making melody to the Lord with all your heart." "He who sings
prays twice."21
1157
Song and music fulfill their function as signs in a manner all
the more significant when they are "more closely connected . . . with
the liturgical action," 22 according to three principal criteria: beauty
expressive of prayer, the unanimous participation of the assembly
at the designated moments, and the solemn character of the cele- 2502
bration. In this way they participate in the purpose of the liturgical
words and actions: the glory of God and the sanctification of the
faithful: 23
How I wept, deeply moved by your hymns, songs, and the
voices that echoed through your Church! What emotion I
experienced in them! Those sounds flowed into my ears,
distilling the truth in my heart. A feeling of devotion surged
within me, and tears streamed down my face - tears that did
me good.24

The harmony of signs (song, music, words, and actions) is
1158
all the more expressive and fruitful when expressed in the cultural 1 201
richness of the People of God who celebrate .25 Hence "religious
singing by the faithful is to be intelligently fostered so that in 1 674
devotions and sacred exercises as well as in liturgical services," in
conformity with the Church's norms, "the voices of the faithful
may be heard." But "the texts intended to be sung must always be
in conformity with Catholic doctrine. Indeed they should be drawn
chiefly from the Sacred Scripture and from liturgical sources."26
476-477

Holy images

2 129-2132

1159
The sacred image, the liturgical icon, principally repre­
sents Christ. lt cannot represent the invisible and incomprehensible
God, but the incarnation of the Son of God has ushered in a new
"economy" of images:

20 sc 112.

26 sc 118; 121.

.

300

Part Two
Previously God, who has neither a body nor a face, abso­
lutely could not be represented by an image. But now that
he has made himself visible in the flesh and has lived with
men, I can make an image of what I have seen of God . . . and
contemplate the glory of the Lord, his face unveiled. 27

Christian iconography expresses in images the same Gos­
1160
pel message that Scripture communicates by words. Image and
word illuminate each other:
We declare that we preserve intact all the written and un­
written traditions of the Church which have been entrusted
to us. One of these traditions consists in the production of
representational artwork, which accords with the history of
the preaching of the Gospel. For it confirms that the incarna­
tion of the Word of God was real and not imaginary, and to
our benefit as well, for realities that illustrate each other
undoubtedly reflect each other's meaning. 28

All the signs in the liturgical celebrations are related to
1161
Christ: as are sacred images of the holy Mother of God and of the
saints as well. They truly signify Christ, who is glorified in them.
They make manifest the "cloud of witnesses" 29 who continue to
participate in the salvation of the world and to whom we are
united, above all in sacramental celebrations. Through their icons,
it is man "in the image of God," finally transfigured "into his
likeness," 30 who is revealed to our faith. So too are the angels, who
also are recapitulated in Christ:
Following the divinely inspired teaching of our holy Fathers
and the tradition of the Catholic Church (for we know that
this tradition comes from the Holy Spirit who dwells in her)
we rightly define with full certainty and correctness that, like
the figure of the precious and life-giving cross, venerable and
holy images of our Lord and God and Savior, Jesus Christ,
our inviolate Lady, the holy Mother of God, and the vener­
ated angels, all the saints and the just, whether painted or
made of mosaic or another suitable material, are to be exhib­
ited in the holy churches of God, on sacred vessels and
1
vestments, walls and panels, in houses and on streets. 3

"The beauty of the images moves me to contemplation, as
a meadow delights the eyes and subtly infuses the soul with the
glory of God." 32 Similarly, the contemplation of sacred icons,

liturgical hymns, enters into the harmony of the signs of celebration
so that the mystery celebrated is imprinted in the heart's memory
and is then expressed in the new life of the faithful.
Ill.

WHEN IS THE LITURGY CELEBRATED?

Liturgical seasons

"Holy Mother Church believes that she should celebrate
1163
the saving work of her divine Spouse in a sacred commemoration
on certain days throughout the course of the year. Once each week,
on the day which she has called the Lord's Day, she keeps the
memory of the Lord's resurrection. She also celebrates it once every
year, together with his blessed Passion, at Easter, that most solemn
of all feasts. In the course of the year, moreover, she unfolds the
whole mystery of Christ . . . . Thus recalling the mysteries of the 512
redemption, she opens up to the faithful the riches of her Lord's
powers and merits, so that these are in some way made present in
every age; the faithful lay hold of them and are filled with saving
grace."33
1164
From the time of the Mosaic law, the People of God have
observed fixed feasts, beginning with Passover, to commemorate the
astonishing actions of the Savior God, to give him thanks for them, to
perpetuate their remembrance, and to teach new generations to con­
form their conduct to them. In the age of the Church, between the
Passover of Christ already accomplished once for all, and its consum­
mation in the kingdom of God, the liturgy celebrated on fixed days
bears the imprint of the newness of the mystery of Christ.
1165
When the Church celebrates the mystery of Christ, there is 2 659-2836
a word that marks her prayer: "Today!" - a word echoing the
prayer her Lord taught her and the call of the Holy Spirit. 34 This
"today" of the living God which man is called to enter is "the hour"
of Jesus' Passover, which reaches across and underlies all history: 1 085
Life extends over all beings and fills them with unlimited
light; the Orient of orients pervades the universe, and he who
was "before the daystar" and before the heavenly bodies,
immortal and vast, the great Christ, shines over all beings
more brightly than the sun. Therefore a day of long, eternal
light is ushered in for us who believe in him, a day which 1S

never blotted out: the mystical Passover.3

1 343 appropriately called the Lord's Day or Sunday."36 The day of
Christ's Resurrection is both the first day of the week, the memorial
of the first day of creation, and the "eighth day," on which Christ
after his "rest" on the great sabbath inaugurates the "day that the
Lord has made," the "day that knows no evening." 37 The Lord's
Supper is its center, for there the whole community of the faithful
encounters the risen Lord who invites them to his banquet:38
The Lord's day, the day of Resurrection, the day of Chris­
tians, is our day. It is called the Lord's day because on it the
Lord rose victorious to the Father. If pagans call it the "day
of the sun," we willingly agree, for today the light of the
world is raised, today is revealed the sun of justice with
healing in his rays.39

Sunday is the pre-eminent day for the liturgical assembly,
1167
when the faithful gather "to listen to the word of God and take part
in the Eucharist, thus calling to mind the Passion, Resurrection, and
glory of the Lord Jesus, and giving thanks to God who 'has begot­
ten them again, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead'
unto a living hope": 40
When we ponder, 0 Christ, the marvels accomplished on
this day, the Sunday of your holy resurrection, we say:
"Blessed is Sunday, for on it began creation . . . the world's
salvation . . . the renewal of the human race .
On Sunday
heaven and earth rejoiced and the whole universe was filled
with light. Blessed is Sunday, for on it were opened the gates
of paradise so that Adam and all the exiles might enter it
4
without fear. 1

The Celebration of the Christian Mystery

303

The liturgical year

1168

Beginning with the Easter Triduum as its source of light,

the new age of the Resurrection fills the whole liturgical year with
its brilliance. Gradually, on either side of this source, the year is 2698
transfigured by the liturgy. It really is a "year of the Lord's favor. "42
The economy of salvation is at work within the framework of time,
but since its fulfillment in the Passover of Jesus and the ou tpouring
of the Holy Spirit, the culmination of history is anticipated "as a
foretaste," and the kingdom of God enters into our time.

1169

Therefore

Easter is not simply one feast am ong others, but

the "Feast of feasts," the "Solemnity of solemnities," just as the
Eucharist is the "Sacrament of sacraments" (the Great Sacrament) .

St. Athanasius calls Easter " the Great Sunday" 43 and the Eastern

1 330

Churches call Holy Week " the Great Week." The mystery of the
Resurrection, in which Christ crushed death, permeates with its 560
powerful energy our old time, until all is subjected to him.

1170
At the Council of Nicaea in 325, all the Churches agreed that
Easter, the Christian Passover, should be celebrated on the Sunday follow­
ing the first full moon (14 Nisan) after the vernal equinox. Because of
different methods of calculating the 14th day of the month of Nisan, the
date of Easter in the Western and Eastern Churches is not always the same.
For this reason, the Churches are currently seeking an agreement in order
once again to celebrate the day of the Lord's Resurrection on a common
date. Today, the Western and Eastern Churches are seeking an agreement
in order once again to celebrate the day of the Lord's Resurrection on a
common date.
1171

In

the liturgical year the various aspects of the one Paschal

mystery unfold. This is also the case with the cycle of feasts surround-

ing the mystery of the incarnation (Annunciation, Christmas, Epiph­
any) . They commemorate the beginning of our salva tion and 524
communicate to us the first fruits of the Paschal mystery.

The sanctoral in the liturgical year

1172

"In celebrating this annual cycle of the mysteries of Christ,

Holy Church honors the Blessed Mary, Mother of God, with a
special love . She is inseparably linked with the saving work of her

971

Son . In her the Church ad mires and exalts the most excellent fruit 2030
of redemption and joyfully contemplates, as in a faultless image,
that which she herself desires and hopes wholly to be."44
42 Lk 4:19 .

When the Church keeps the memorials of martyrs and

other saints during the annual cycle, she proclaims the Paschal
mystery in those "who have suffered and have been glorified with
Christ . She proposes them to the faithful as examples who draw all
men to the Father through Christ, and through their merits she begs
for God's favors . "45

The Liturgy of the Hours

1174

The mystery of Christ, his Incarnation and Passover, which

we celebrate in the Eucharist especially at the Sunday assembly,
permeates and transfigures the time of each day, through the celebra­
tion of the Liturgy of the Hours, "the divine office."46 This celebration,

2698 faithful to the apostolic exhortations to "pray constantly," is "so

devised that the whole course of the day and night is made holy by
the praise of God."47 In this "public prayer of the Church,"48 the
faithful (clergy, religious, and lay people) exercise the royal priest­

hood of the baptized. Celebrated in "the form approved" by the

Church, the Liturgy of the Hours "is truly the voice of the Bride herself

addressed to her Bridegroom. It is the very prayer which Christ
himself together with his Body addresses to the Father."49

1175
The Liturgy of the Hours is intended to become the prayer of the
whole People of God. In it Christ himself "continues his priestly work
through his Church . '' 50 His members participate according to their own
place in the Church and the circumstances of their lives: priests devoted
to the pastoral ministry, because they are called to remain diligent in
prayer and the service of the word; religious, by the charism of their
consecrated lives; all the faithful as much as possible: "Pastors of souls
should see to it that the principal hours, especially Vespers, are celebrated
in common in church on Sundays and on the more solemn feasts. The la ity,
too, are encouraged to recite the divine office, either with the priests, or
among themselves, or even individually. ''51
1176

The celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours demands not

2 700 only harmonizing the voice with the praying heart, but also a

deeper "unders tanding of the liturgy and of the Bible, especially of
the Psalms . " 52

1177
The hynms and litanies of the Liturgy of the Hours inte­
grate the prayer of the psalms into the age of the Church, expressing the symbolism of the time of day, the liturgical season, or the 2586
feast being celebrated. Moreover, the reading from the Word of
God at each Hour (with the subsequent responses or troparia) and
readings from the Fathers and spiritual masters at certain Hours,
reveal more deeply the meaning of the mystery being celebrated,
assist in understanding the psalms, and prepare for silent prayer.
The lectio divina, where the Word of God is so read and meditated
that it becomes prayer, is thus rooted in the liturgical celebration.
1178
The Liturgy of the Hours, which is like an extension of the
Eucharistic celebration, does not exclude but rather in a comple­
mentary way calls forth the various devotions of the People of God,
especially adoration and worship of the Blessed Sacrament.
1378

IV.

WHERE Is TII E LITURGY CELEBRATED?

The worship "in Spirit and in truth"53 of the New Cove1179
nant is not tied exclusively to any one place. The whole earth is
sacred and entrusted to the children of men. What matters above
all is that, when the faithful assemble in the same place, they are
the "living stones," gathered to be "built into a spiritual house." 54
For the Body of the risen Christ is the spiritual temple from which 586
the source of living water springs forth: incorporated into Christ
by the Holy Spirit, "we are the temple of the living God."55
1180
When the exercise of religious liberty is not thwarted,56 2 1 06
Christians construct buildings for divine worship . These visible
churches are not simply gathering places but signify and make
visible the Church living in this place, the dwelling of God with
men reconciled and united in Christ.
1181
A church, "a house of prayer in which the Eucharist is 2691
celebrated and reserved, where the faithful assemble, and where is
worshipped the presence of the Son of God our Savior, offered for
us on the sacrificial altar for the help and consolation of the faithful
- this house ought to be in good taste and a worthy place for prayer
and sacred ceremonial."57 In this "house of God" the truth and the
harmony of the signs that make it up should show Christ to be
present and active in this place.58

53 Jn 4:24 .
5 4 1 Pet 2:4-5.

Part Two

The altar of the New Covenant is the Lord's Cross, 59 from which
the sacraments of the Paschal mystery flow. On the altar, which is the
center of the church, the sacrifice of the Cross is made present under
sacramental signs . The altar is also the table of the Lord, to which the
People of God are invited.60 In certain Eastern liturgies, the altar is also
the symbol of the tomb (Christ truly died and is truly risen).

61 7, 1383 1182

1 3 79 1183
The ta be rnacle is to be situated "in churches in a most worthy
2120 place with the greatest honor. " 6 l The dignity, placing, and security of the
Eucharistic tabernacle should foster adoration before the Lord really
present in the Blessed Sacrament of the altar.62

1 241

The sacred chrism (myron), used in anointings as the sacramental
sign of the seal of the gift of the Holy Spirit, is traditionally reserved and
venerated in a secure place in the sanctuary. The oil of catechumens and
the oil of the sick may also be placed there.

1348 1184

The chair of the bishop (cathedra) or that of the priest "should
express his office of presiding over the assembly and of directing prayer."63

103

The lectern (ambo): "The dignity of the Word of God requires the
church to have a suitable place for announcing his message so that the
attention of the people may be easily directed to that place during the
liturgy of the Word . " 64

1185
The gathering of the People of God begins with Baptism; a church
must have a place for the celebration of Baptism (baptistry) and for foster­
ing remembrance of the baptismal promises (holy water font).
The renewal of the baptismal life requires penance. A church,
then, must lend itself to the expression of repentance and the reception of
forgiveness, which requires an appropriate place to receive penitents.

2 71 7

A church must also be a space that invites us to the recollection
and silent prayer that extend and internalize the great prayer of the
Eucharist.

1186

Finally, the church has an escha tological significance. To

enter into the house of God, we must cross a

threshold,

which

1 1 30 symbolizes pass ing from the world wounded by sin to the world
of the new Life to which all men are called . The visible church is a

symbol of the Father's house toward which the People of God is

journeying and where the Father "will wipe every tear from their
eyes . "65 Also for this reason, the Church is the house of all God's
child ren, open and welcoming.

The Celebration of the Christian Mystery

IN

B RIEF

1187

The liturgy is the work of the whole Christ, head and
body. Our high priest celebrates it unceasingly in the
heavenly liturgy, with the holy Mother of God, the
apostles, all the saints, and the multitude of those who
have already entered the kingdom.

1188

In a liturgical celebration, the whole assembly is leitour­
gos, each member according to his own function. The
baptismal priesthood is that of the whole Body of Christ.
But some of the faithful are ordained through the sacra­
ment of Holy Orders to represent Christ as head of the
Body.

1189

The liturgical celebration involves signs and symbols
relating to creation (candles, water, fire), human life
(washing, anointing, breaking bread) and the history
of salvation (the rites of the Passover). Integrated into
the world of faith and taken up by the power of the
Holy Spirit, these cosmic elements, humap rituals, and
gestures of remembrance of God become bearers of the
saving and sanctifying action of Christ.

1190

The Liturgy of the Word is an integral part of the
celebration. The meaning of the celebration is ex­
pressed by the Word of God which is proclaimed and
by the response of faith to it.

1191

Song and music are closely connected with the liturgical
action. The criteria for their proper use are the beauty
expressive of prayer, the unanimous participation of the
assembly, and the sacred character of the celebration.

1192

Sacred images in our churches and homes are in­
tended to awaken and nourish our faith in the mystery
of Christ. Through the icon of Christ and his works of
salvation, it is he whom we adore. Through sacred
images of the holy Mother of God, of the angels and
of the saints, we venerate the persons represented.

1193

Sunday, the "Lord's Day," is the principal day for the
celebration of the Eucharist because it is the day of the
Resurrection. It is the pre-eminent day of the liturgical

65 Rev 21 :4.

307

308

Part Two
assembly, the day of the Christian family, and the day
of joy and rest from work. Sunday is "the foundation
and kernel of the whole liturgical year" (SC 106).

1194

The Church, "in the course of the year, . . . unfolds the
whole mystery of Christ from his Incarnation and
Nativity through his Ascension, to Pentecost and the
expectation of the blessed hope of the coming of the
Lord" (SC 102 § 2).

1195

By keeping the memorials of the saints - first of all the
holy Mother of God, then the apostles, the martyrs,
and other saints - on fixed days of the liturgical year,
the Church on earth shows that she is united with the
liturgy of heaven. She gives glory to Christ for having
accomplished his salvation in his glorified members;
their example encourages her on her way to the Father.

1196

The faithful who celebrate the Liturgy of the Hours are
united to Christ our high priest, by the prayer of the
Psalms, meditation on the Word of God, and canticles
and blessings, in order to be joined with his unceasing
and universal prayer that gives glory to the Father and
implores the gift of the Holy Spirit on the whole world.

1197

Christ is the true temple of God, "the place where his
glory dwells"; by the grace of God, Christians also
become temples of the Holy Spirit, living stones out of
which the Church is built.

1198

In its earthly state the Church needs places where the
community can gather together. Our visible churches,
holy places, are images of the holy city, the heavenly
Jerusalem, toward which we are making our way on
pilgrimage.

1199

It is in these churches that the Church celebrates public
worship to the glory of the Holy Trinity, hears the
word of God and sings his praise, lifts up her prayer,
and offers the sacrifice of Christ sacramentally present
in the midst of the assembly. These churches are also
places of recollection and personal prayer.

ARTICLE 2
LITURGICAL DIVERSITY AND
THE UNITY OF THE MYSTERY

Liturgical traditions and the catholicity of the Church

1200
From the first community of Jerusalem until the parousia,
it is the same Paschal mystery that the Churches of God, faithful to
the apostolic faith, celebrate in every place. The mystery celebrated
in the liturgy is one, but the forms of its celebration are diverse.
2625
1201
The mystery of Christ is so unfathomably rich that it
cannot be exhausted by its expression in any single liturgical
tradition. The history of the blossoming and development of these 2663
rites witnesses to a remarkable complementarity. When the
Churches lived their respective liturgical traditions in the com­
munion of the faith and the sacraments of the faith, they enriched 1 158
one another and grew in fidelity to Tradition and to the common
mission of the whole Church. 66
1202
The diverse liturgical traditions have arisen by very reason
of the Church's mission. Churches of the same geographical and
cultural area came to celebrate the mystery of Christ through
particular expressions characterized by the culture: in the tradition
of the "deposit of faith," 67 in liturgical symbolism, in the organization of fraternal communion, in the theological understanding of
the mysteries, and in various forms of holiness. Through the liturgical life of a local church, Christ, the light and salvation of all
peoples, is made manifest to the particular people and culture to
which that Church is sent and in which she is rooted. The Church
is catholic, capable of integrating into her unity, while purifying
them, all the authentic riches of cultures. 68
1203
The liturgical traditions o r rites presently i n use i n the Church are
the Latin (principally the Roman rite, but also the rites of certain local
churches, such as the Ambrosian rite, or those of certain religious orders)
and the Byzantine, Alexandrian or Coptic, Syriac, Armenian, Maronite,
and Chaldean rites. In "faithful obedience to tradition, the sacred Council
declares that Holy Mother Church holds all lawfully recognized rites to be
of equal right and dignity, and that she wishes to preserve them in the
9
future and to foster them in every way."6

Part Two

Liturgy and culture
2684 1204

The celebration of the liturgy, therefore, should corre-

spond to the genius and culture of the different peoples ?0 In order

that the mystery of Christ be "made known to all the nations . . . to
bring about the obedience of faith,"71 it must be proclaimed, cele­
brated, and lived in all cultures in such a way that they themselves

854, 1 232 are not abolished by it, but redeemed and fulfilled:72 It is with and
2527 through their own human culture, assumed and transfigured by
Christ, that the multitude of God's children has access to the Father,
in order to glorify him in the one Spirit.

"In the liturgy, above all that of the sacraments, there is an
immutable part, a part that is divinely instituted and of which the
Church is the guardian, and parts that can be changed, which the

1 1 25 1205

Church has the power and on occasion also the duty to adapt to
the cultures of recently evangelized peoples."73

1206
"Liturgical diversity can be a source of enrichiLlent, but it
can also provoke tensions, mutual misunderstandings, and even
schisms.

In

this matter it is clear that diversity must not damage

unity. It must express only fidelity to the common faith, to the
sacramental signs that the Church has received from Christ, and to
hierarchical communion. Cultural adaptation also requires a con­
version of heart and even, where necessary, a breaking with ances­
tral customs incompatible with the Catholic faith."74

IN

BRIEF

1207

It is fitting that liturgical celebration tends to express itself
in the culture of the people where the Church finds herself,
though without being submissive to it. Moreover, the
liturgy itself generates cultures and shapes them.

1208

The diverse liturgical traditions or rites, legitimately rec­
ognized, manifest the catholicity of the Church, because
they signify and communicate the same mystery of Christ.

1209

The criterion that assures unity amid the diversity of
liturgical traditions is fidelity to apostolic Tradition, i.e.,
the communion in the faith and the sacraments received
from the apostles, a communion that is both signified
and guaranteed by apostolic succession.

SECTION Two
THE SEVEN SACRAMENTS
OF THE CHURCH
1210
Christ instituted the sacraments of the new law. There are 1 1 1 3
seven: Baptism, Confirmation (or Chrismation), the Eucharist, Penance, the Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders and Matrimony. The
seven sacraments touch all the stages and all the important moments
of Christian life: 1 they give birth and increase, healing and mission to
the Christian's life of faith. There is thus a certain resemblance be­
tween the stages of natural life and the stages of the spiritual life.
1211
Following this analogy, the first chapter will expound the
three sacraments of Christian initiation; the second, the sacraments
of healing; and the third, the sacraments at the service of communion and the mission of the faithful. This order, while not the only
one possible, does allow one to see that the sacraments form an
organic whole in which each particular sacrament has its own vital
place. In this organic whole, the Eucharist occupies a unique place
as the "Sacrament of sacraments" : "all the other sacraments are 1374
ordered to it as to their end." 2

C HAPTER ONE
THE SACRAMENTS OF C HRISTIAN INITIATION
1212
The sacraments of Christian initiation - Baptism, Confir­
mation, and the Eucharist - lay the foundations of every Christian
life. "The sharing in the divine nature given to men through the
grace of Christ bears a certain likeness to the origin, development,
and nourishing of natural life. The faithful are born anew by
Baptism, strengthened by the sacrament of Confirmation, and
receive in the Eucharist the food of eternal life. By means of these
sacraments of Christian initiation, they thus receive in increasing
measure the treasures of the divine life and advance toward the
perfection of charity." 3

A RTICLE 1
THE S A CRAMENT OF BAPTISM

1213

Holy Baptism is the basis of the whole Christian life, the

gateway to life in the Spirit

(vital' spiritualis ianua),4

and the door

which gives access to the other sacra ments . Through Baptism we
are freed from sin and reborn as sons of God; we become members
of Christ, are incorporated into the Church and made sharers in her
mission: "Bap tism is the sacrament of regeneration through water
and in the word . "5

I.

WHAT Is THIS SACRAMENT CALLED?

1214

This sacrament is called

which i t is carried out: to

Baptism, after the central rite by
baptize (Greek baptizein) means to

"plunge" or "immerse"; the "plunge" into the water symbolizes

628 the catechumen's burial into Christ's death, from which he rises up
by resurrection with him, as "a new creature. " 6

1215
This sacrament is also called "the wash ing of rege nera tio n
and re newal by th e Ho ly Sp irit," for it signifies and actually brings
1257 about the birth of water and the Spirit without which no one "can
enter the kingdom of God." 7

1216

"This bath is called enlightenment, because those who receive

this [ catechetical] instruction are enlightened in their understanding .

"
. . . 8 Having received in Baptism the Word, " the true light that

enlightens every man," the person baptized has been "enlightened,"

1243 he becomes a "son of light," indeed, he becomes "light" himself:9
Baptism is God's most beautiful and magnificent gift . . . . We
call it gift, grace, anointing, enlightenment, garment of im­
mortality, bath of rebirth, seal, and most precious gift. It is
called gift because it is conferred on those who bring nothing
of their own; grace since it is given even to the guilty; Baptism
because sin is buried in the water; anointing for it is priestly
and royal as are those who are anointed; enlightenment be­
cause it radiates light; clothing since it veils our shame; bath
because it washes� and seal as it is our guard and the sign of
God's Lordship. 1v

BAPTISM IN THE ECONOMY OF SAL VATION

Prefigurations of Baptism in the Old Covenant

1217
In the liturgy of the Easter Vigil, during the blessing of the
baptismal water, the Church solemnly commemorates the great events
in salvation history that already prefigured the mystery of Baptism:
Father, you give us grace through sacramental signs,
which tell us of the wonders of your unseen power.
In Baptism we use your gift of water,
which you have made a rich symbol
of the grace you give us in this sacrament. 11

1218
Since the beginning of the world, water, so humble and 344
wonderful a creature, has been the source of life and fruitfulness. 694
Sacred Scripture sees it as "overshadowed" by the Spirit of God: 1 2
At the very dawn of creation
your Spirit breathed on the waters,
making them the wellspring of all holiness. 13

1219
The Church has seen in Noah's ark a prefiguring of salva- 701, 845
tion by Baptism, for by it "a few, that is, eight persons, were saved
through water" : 1 4
The waters of the great flood
you made a sign of the waters of Baptism,
that make an end of sin and a new beginning of goodness. 1 5

1220
If water springing up from the earth symbolizes life, the
water of the sea is a symbol of death and so can represent the
mystery of the cross. By this symbolism Baptism signifies commun- 1 010
ion with Christ's death.
1221
But above all, the crossing of the Red Sea, literally the
liberation of Israel from the slavery of Egypt, announces the libera­
tion wrought by Baptism:
You freed the children of Abraham from the slavery ofPharaoh,
bringing them dry-shod through the waters of the Red Sea,
to be an image of the people set free in Baptism. 16

1222
Finally, Baptism is prefigured in the crossing of the Jordan
River by which the People of God received the gift of the land

promised to Abraham's descendants, an image of eternal life. The

1223
All the Old Covenant prefigurations find their fulfillment
in Christ Jesus. He begins his public life after having himself
baptized by St. John the Baptist in the JordanP After his resurrec­
tion Christ gives this mission to his apostles: "Go therefore and
make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
232 Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to
observe all that I have commanded you ." 18

Our Lord voluntarily submitted himself to the baptism of
St. John, intended for sinners, in order to "fulfill all righteous­
ness." 19 Jesus' gesture is a manifestation of his self-emptying.20 The
Spirit who had hovered over the waters of the first creation de­
scended then on the Christ as a prelude of the new creation, and
the Father revealed Jesus as his "beloved Son." 21

1225
In his Passover Christ opened to all men the fountain of
Baptism. He had already spoken of his Passion, which he was
about to suffer in Jerusalem, as a "Baptism" with which he had to
766 be baptized.2 2 The blood and water that flowed from the pierced
side of the crucified Jesus are types of Baptism and the Eucharist,
the sacraments of new life.23 From then on, it is possible "to be born
of water and the Spirit"24 in order to enter the Kingdom of God.
See where you are bap tized, see where Baptism comes from,
if not from the cross of Christ, from his death. There is the
whole mystery: he died for you. In him you are redeemed,
in him you are saved.25

Baptism in the Church
1226
From the very day of Pentecost the Church has celebrated
and administered holy Baptism. Indeed St. Peter declares to the
crowd astounded by his preaching: "Repent, and be baptized every
849 one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your

sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." 26 The
apostles and their collaborators offer Baptism to anyone who be­
lieved in Jesus: Jews, the God-fearing, pagansP Always, Baptism
is seen as connected with faith: "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you
will be saved, you and your household," St. Paul declared to his
jailer in Philippi. And the narrative continues, the jailer "was
baptized at once, with all his family."28
According to the Apostle Paul, the believer enters through
1227
Baptism into communion with Christ's death, is buried with him, 790
and rises with him:
Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into
Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried
therefore with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ
was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too
might walk in newness of life. 29

The baptized have "put on Christ."3 ° Through the Holy Spirit,
Baptism is a bath that purifies, justifies, and sanctifies.3 1
1228
Hence Baptism is a bath of water in which the "imperish­
able seed" of the Word of God produces its life-giving effect.3 2 St .
Augustine says of Baptism: "The word is brought to the material
element, and it becomes a sacrament."33

How Is TIIE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM CELEBRATED ?

Christian Initiation

1229
From the time of the apostles, becoming a Christian has
been accomplished by a journey and initiation in several stages.
This journey can be covered rapidly or slowly, but certain essential
elements will always have to be present: proclamation of the Word,
acceptance of the Gospel entailing conversion, profession of faith,
Baptism itself, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and admission to
Eucharistic communion.
1230
This initiation has varied greatly through the centuries according
to circumstances. In the first centuries of the Church, Christian initiation
saw considerable development. A long period of catechumenate included a
series of preparatory rites, which were liturgical landmarks along the p ath 1 248
26 Acts 2:3 8.

of catechumenal preparation and culminated in the celebration of the
sacra ments of Christian initiation.

13

1231
Where infant Baptism has become the form in which this sacra­
ment is usually celebrated, it has become a single act encapsulating the
preparatory stages of Christian initiation in a very abridged way. By its
very nature infant Baptism requires a post-baptismal catechumenate. Not
only is there a need for instruction after Baptism, but also for the necessary
flowering of baptismal grace in personal growth. The catechism has its
proper place here.

1232
The second Vatican Council restored for the Latin Church "the
catechumenate for adults, comprising several distinct steps."34 The rites
for these stages are to be found in the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults
(RCIA).3 5 The Council also gives permission that: "In mission countries,
in addition to what is furnished by the Christian tradition, those elements
1 204 of initiation rites may be admitted which are already in use among some
peoples insofar as they can be adapted to the Christian ritual. "36
1233
Today in all the rites, Latin and Eastern, the Christian initiation
of adults begins with their entry into the catechumenate and reaches its
culmination in a single celebration of the three sacraments of initiation:
Baptism, Confirmation, and the Eucharist.37 In the Eastern rites the Chris­
tian initiation of infants also begins with Baptism followed immediately
by Confirmation and the Eucharist, while in the Roman rite it is followed
by years of catechesis before being completed later by Confirmation and
the Eucharist, the summit of their Christian initiation. 38
The mystagogy of the celebration
1234
The meaning and grace of the sacrament of Baptism are
clearly seen in the rites of its celebration. By following the gestures
and words of this celebration with attentive participation, the
faithful are initiated into the riches this sacrament signifies and
actually brings about in each newly baptized person.

The sign ofthe cross, on the threshold of the celebration, marks
with the imprint of Christ the one who is going to belong to him and
2157 signifies the grace of the redemption Christ won for us by his cross.
6 1 7 1235

1236
The proclamation of the Word of God enlightens the can­
didates and the assembly with the revealed truth and elicits the
1 1 12 response of faith, which is inseparable from Baptism. Indeed Bap­
tism is "the sacrament of faith" in a particular way, since it is the
sacramental entry into the life of faith.

The Celebration of the Christian Mystery

317

1237
Since Baptism signifies liberation from sin and from its
instigator the devil, one or more exorcisms are pronounced over the
candidate . The celebrant then anoints him with the oil of catechu- 1 673
mens, or lays his hands on him, and he explicitly renounces Satan.
Thus prepared, he is able to confess the faith of the Church, to which 1 89
he will be "entrusted" by Baptism.39
1238
The baptismal water is consecrated by a prayer of epiclesis 1 2 1 7
(either at this moment or at the Easter Vigil). The Omrch asks God
that through his Son the power of the Holy Spirit may be sent upon
the water, so that those who will be baptized in it may be "born of
water and the Spirit."40
1239
The essential rite of the sacrament follows: Baptism properly 1 2 1 4
speaking. I t signifies and actually brings about death t o sin and
entry into the life of the Most Holy Trinity through configuration
to the Paschal mystery of Christ. Baptism is performed in the most
expressive way by triple immersion in the baptismal water. However, from ancient times it has also been able to be conferred by
pouring the water three times over the candidate's head.
1240
In the Latin Church this triple infusion is accompanied by the
minister's words: "N., I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Spirit." In the Eastern liturgies the catechumen turns
toward the East and the priest says: "The servant of God, N., is baptized
in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit." At the
invocation of each person of the Most Holy Trinity, the priest immerses
the candidate in the water and raises him up again.
1241
The anointing with sacred chrism, perfumed oil consecrated by 1294, 1574
the bishop, signifies the gift of the Holy Spirit to the newly baptized,
who has become a Christian, that is, one "anointed" by the Holy Spirit,
incorporated into Christ who is anointed priest, prophet, and king.41 783
1242
In the liturgy of the Eastern Churches, the post-baptismal
anointing is the sacrament of Chrismation (Confirmation). In the
Roman liturgy the post-baptismal anointing announces a second
anointing with sacred chrism to be conferred later by the bishop Confirmation, which will as it were "confirm" and complete the 1 2 91
baptismal anointing.
1243
The white garment symbolizes that the person baptized
has "put on Christ,"4 2 has risen with Christ. The candle, lit from the
Easter candle, signifies that Christ has enlightened the neophyte.
1216
In him the baptized are "the light of the world."43

Part Two
The newly baptized is now, in the only Son, a child of God

2769 entitled to say the prayer of the children of God: "Our Father."

1244
First Holy Commzm ion . Having become a child of God
clothed with the wedding garment, the neophyte is admitted "to
the marriage supper of the Lamb" 44 and receives the food of the
new life, the body and blood of Christ. The Eastern Churches
maintain a lively awareness of the unity of Christian initiation by
giving Holy Communion to all the newly baptized and confirmed,
1 2 92 even little children, recalling the Lord's words: "Let the children
come to me, do not hinder them ." 45 The Latin Church, which
reserves admission to Holy Communion to those who have at­
tained the age of reason, expresses the orientation of Baptism to the
Eucharist by having the newly baptized child brought to the altar
for the praying of the Our Father.
1245
The solemn blessing concludes the celebration of Baptism .
At the Baptism of newborns the blessing of the mother occupies a
special place.
IV.

WHO CAN RECEIVE BAPTISM?

"Every person not yet baptized and only such a person is
1246
able to be baptized."46
The Baptism of adults
1247
Since the beginning of the Church, adult Baptism is the
common practice where the proclamation of the Gospel is still new.
The catechumenate (preparation for Baptism) therefore occupies
an important place. This initiation into Christian faith and life
should dispose the catechumen to receive the gift of God in Bap­
tism, Confirmation, and the Eucharist.

The catechumenate, or formation of catechumens, aims at
bringing their conversion and faith to maturity, in response to the
divine initiative and in union with an ecclesial community. The
catechumenate is to be "a formation in the whole Christian life . . .
during which the disciples will be joined to Christ their teacher.
The catechumens should be properly initiated into the mystery of
salvation and the practice of the evangelical virtues, and they

should be introduced into the life of faith, liturgy, and charity of
the People of God by successive sacred rites."4 7
1249
Catechumens "are already joined to the Church, they are 1 259
already of the household of Christ, and are quite frequently already
living a life of faith, hope, and charity."48 "With love and solicitude
mother Church already embraces them as her own."49
The Baptism of infants
1250
Born with a fallen human nature and tainted by original 403
sin, children also have need of the new birth in Baptism to be freed
from the power of darkness and brought into the realm of the
freedom of the children of God, to which all men are called. 50 The
sheer gratuitousness of the grace of salvation is particularly mani- 1 996
fest in infant Baptism. The Church and the parents would deny a
child the priceless grace of becoming a child of God were they not
to confer Baptism shortly after birth.51
1251
Christian parents will recognize that this practice also
accords with their role as nurturers of the life that God has en­
trusted to them. 52
1252
The practice of infant Baptism is an immemorial tradition of the
Church. There is explicit testimony to this practice from the second century
on, and it is quite possible that, from the beginning of the apostolic
preaching, when whole "households" received baptism, infants may also
5
have been baptized. 3
Faith and Baptism
1253
Baptism is the sacrament of faith.54 But faith needs the 1 1 23
community of believers. It is only within the faith of the Church
that each of the faithful can believe. The faith required for Baptism
is not a perfect and mature faith, but a beginning that is called to
develop. The catechumen or the godparent is asked: "What do you 1 68
ask of God's Church?" The response is: "Faith!"

320

Part Two
For all the baptized, children or adults, faith must grow

1254

after

Baptism. For this reason the Church celebrates each year at the Easter

Vigil the renewal of baptismal promises. Preparation for Baptism

2 1 01 leads only to the threshold of new life . Baptism is the source of that
new life

in Christ from which the entire Christian life springs forth.

1255

For the grace of Baptism to unfold, the parents' help is impor­

tant. So too is the role of the godfather and godmother, who must be firm

131 1 believers, able and ready to help the newly baptized - child or adult ­
on the road of Christian life.55 Their task is a truly ecclesial function

(officium).56 The whole ecclesial community bears some responsibility
for the development and safeguarding of the grace given at Baptism.

V.

WHO CAN BAPTIZE?

1256

The ordinary ministers of Baptism are the bishop and

1 239-1 240 p riest and, in the Latin Church, also the deacon.57 In case of
necessity, anyone, even a non-baptized person, with the required

intention, can baptize, 58 by using the Trinitarian baptismal for­
mula. The intention required is to will to do what the Church does

1 752 when she baptizes . The Church finds the reason for this possibility

in the universal saving will of God and the necessity of Bap tism for
salvation. 59

VI.
1 1 29 1257

THE NECESSITY OF BAPTISM
The Lord himself affirms that Baptism is necessary for

salvation. 60 He also commands his disci pies to p roclaim the Gospel
to all nations and to baptize them. 61 Bap tism is necessary for
salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and

1 61 , 846 who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament. 62 The
Church does not know of any means other than Baptism that

assures entry into eternal beatitude; this is why she takes care not
to neglect the mission she has received from the Lord to see that all

who can be baptized are " reborn of water and the Spirit. "

God has
bound salvation to the sacrament of Baptism, but he himself is not bound
by his sacraments.

The Celebration of the Christian Mystery
1258

The Church has always held the firm conviction that those

who suffer death for the sake of the faith withou t having received
Bap tism are baptized by their death for and with Christ. This

Baptism of blood, like the desirefor Baptism, brings

about the fruits of

2473

For catechumens who die before their Bap tism, their explicit

1 249

1259

desire to receive it, together with repentance for their sins, and
charity, assures them the salvation that they were not able to
receive through the sacrament.

1260

"Since Christ died for all, and since all men are in fact called

to one and the same destiny, which is divine, we must hold that the

Holy Spirit offers to all the possibility of being made partakers, in a
way known to God, of the Paschal mystery." 63 Every man who is

848

ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth
and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it,

can be saved. It may be supposed that such persons would have desired

Baptism explicitly if they had known its necessity.
1261

As regards

children who have died without Baptism,

the

1257

Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God, as she does in
her funeral rites for them. Indeed, the great mercy of God who
desires that all men should be saved, and Jesus' tenderness toward
children which caused him to say: "Let the children come to me,
do not hinder them," 64 allow us to hope that there is a way of
salvation for children who have died without Bap tism . All the
more urgent is the Church's call not to prevent little children

1 250

coming to Christ through the gift of holy Baptism.

VII.

THE GRACE OF BAPTISM

1262

The different effects of Baptism are signified by the percep-

1234

tible elements of the sacramental rite. Immersion in water symbol-

izes not only death and purification, but also regeneration and

renewal. Thus the two principal effects are purification from sins

and new birth in the Holy Spirit.65

For the forgiveness of sins . . .

all sins

are forgiven, original sin and all per-

sonal sins, as well as all punishment for sin. 66 In those who have

Part Two

been reborn nothing remains that would impede their entry into

the Kingdom of God, neither Adam's sin, nor personal sin, nor the
consequences of sin, the gravest of which is separation from God .

1264

Yet certain temporal consequences of sin remain in the

bap tized, such as suffering, illness, death, and such frailties inher­
ent in life as wea knesses of character, and so on, as well as an

975, 251 4 inclination to sin that Tradition calls concupiscence, or metaphori1 426 cally, "the tinder for sin" (james peccati); since concupiscence "is left
for us to wrestle with, it cannot harm those who do not consent but
manfully resis t it by the grace of Jesus Christ." 67 Indeed, "an athlete
405 is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. "6 8

11A new creature"
505 1265
Baptism not only purifies from all sins, but also makes the
460 neophyte "a new creature," an adopted son of God, who has
become a "partaker of the divine nature," 69 member of Christ and
co-heir with him,7° and a temple of the Holy Spirit. 71

1266

The Most Holy Trinity gives the bap tized sanctifying

grace, the grace of justifica tio n:

1 992 - enabling them t o believe i n God, t o hope i n him, and t o love him
through the theological virtues;

1 81 2 - giving them the power to live and act under the prompting of the
Holy Spirit through the gifts of the Holy Spirit;

1 83 1 - allowing them to grow in goodness through the moral virtues.
1 81 0 Thus the whole organism of the Christian's supernatural life has
its roots

in Baptism.

Incorporated into the Church, the Body of Christ
782 1267

Bap tism makes us members of the Body of Christ: "There-

fore . . . we are members one of another." 72 Baptism incorporates

us

into the Church. From the bap tismal fonts is born the one People

of God of the New Covenant, which transcends all the natural or

human limits of nations, cultures, races, and sexes: "For by one
Spirit we were all baptized into one body." 73

1268
The baptized have become "living stones" to be "built into
a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood ." 74 By Baptism they share
in the priesthood of Christ, in his prophetic and royal mission. They
are "a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's own 1 1 41
people, that [they] may declare the wonderful deeds of him who
called [them] out of darkness into his marvelous light. "75 Baptism

gives a share in the common priesthood of all believers.

784

Having become a member of the Church, the person bap­
tized belongs no longer to himself, but to him who died and rose
for us?6 From now on, he is called to be subject to others, to serve
them in the communion of the Church, and to "obey and submit"
to the Church's leaders, 77 holding them in respect and affection?8 871
Just as Baptism is the source of responsibilities and duties, the
bap tized person also enjoys rights within the Church: to receive the
sacraments, to be nourished with the Word of God and to be
sustained by the other spiritual helps of the Church?9

1269

1270
"Reborn as sons of God, [the baptized] must profess before
men the faith they have received from God through the Church"
and participate in the apostolic and missionary activity of the
People of God. 80
The sacramental bond of the unity of Christians
Baptism constitutes the foundation of communion among
all Christians, including those who are not yet in full communion
with the Catholic Church: "For men who believe in Christ and have
been properly baptized are put in some, though imperfect, com­
munion with the Catholic Church. Justified by faith in Baptism,
[they] are incorporated into Christ; they therefore have a right to
be called Christians, and with good reason are accepted as brothers
by the children of the Catholic Church."81 "Baptism therefore
constitutes the sacramen tal bond of unity existing among all who
through it are rebom." 82

An indelible spiritual mark . . .

1272
Incorporated into Christ by Baptism, the person baptized
is configured to Christ. Baptism seals the Christian with the indel­
ible spiritual mark (character) of his belonging to Christ. No sin can
erase this mark, even if sin prevents Ba ptism from bearing the fruits
of salvation. 83 Given once for all, Baptism canno t be repeated.
1273
Incorporated into the Church by Baptism, the faithful have
received the sacramental character that consecrates them for Chris­
tian religious worship . 84 The baptismal seal enables and commits
Christians to serve God by a vital participation in the holy liturgy
of the Church and to exercise their baptismal priesthood by the
witness of holy lives and practical charity. 85
1274
The Holy Spirit has marked us with the seal of the Lord
("Dominicus character") "for the day of redemption." 86 "Baptism

indeed is the seal of etemal life." 87 The faithful Christian who has
"kept the seal" until the end, remaining faithful to the demands of
his Bap tism, will be able to depart this life "marked with the sign
1 9 7 of faith," 88 with his baptismal faith, in expectation of the blessed
2016 vision of God - the consummation of faith - and in the hope of
resurrection.

IN BRIEF
1275

Christian initiation is accomplished by three sacraments
together: Baptism which is the beginning of new life;
Confirmation which is its strengthening; and the Eucha­
rist which nourishes the disciple with Christ's Body and
Blood for his transformation in Christ.

1276

"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, bap­
tizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that
I have commanded you" (Mt 28: 19-20) .

1277

Baptism is birth into the new life in Christ. In accord­
ance with the Lord 's will, it is necessary for salvation,
as is the Church herself, which we enter by Baptism.

The essential rite of Baptism consists in immersing the
candidate in water or pouring water on his head, while
pronouncing the invocation of the Most Holy Trinity:
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

1279

The fruit of Baptism, or baptismal grace, is a rich reality
that includes forgiveness of original sin and all personal
sins, birth into the new life by which man becomes an
adoptive son of the Father, a member of Christ and a
temple of the Holy Spirit. By this very fact the person
baptized is incorporated into the Church, the Body of
Christ, and made a sharer in the priesthood of Christ.

1280

Bap tism imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual
sign, the character, which consecrates the bap tized
person for Christian worship . Because of the character
Bap tism cannot be repeated

1281

(d. DS 1609 and DS 1 624).

Those who die for the faith, those who are catechu­
mens, and all those who, without knowing of the
Church but acting under the inspiration of grace, seek
God sincerely and strive to fulfill his will, can be saved
even if they have not been baptized (cf.

1282

LG 16).

Since the earliest times, Bap tism has been adminis­
tered to children, for it is a grace and a gift of God that
does not presuppose any human meri t; children are
baptized in the faith of the Church . Entry into Chris­
tian life gives access to true freedom.

1283

With respect to children who have died without Bap­
tism, the liturgy of the Church invites us to trust in
God's mercy and to pray for their salvation.

1284

In case of necessity, any person can baptize provided that
he have the intention of doing that which the Church
does and provided that he pours water on the candi­
date's head while saying: "I baptize you in the name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."

ARTICLE 2
THE SA CRAMENT OF CONFIRMATION

1285

Baptism, the Eucharist, and the sacrament of Confirmation
together constitute the "sacraments of Christian initiation," whose

unity must be safeguarded . It must be explained to the faithful that
the reception of the sacrament of Confirmation is necessary for the

326

Part Two

comple tion of bap tismal grace. 89 For "by the sacrament of Confir­
ma tion, [the baptized] are more perfec tly bound to the Church and
are enriched with a special s trength of the Holy Spiri t. Hence they
are, as true witnesses of Christ, more strictly obliged to spread and

defend the faith by word and deed ." 90

I.

CONFIRMATION IN THE ECONOMY OF SALVATION

1286

In the Old Testament the prophets announced that the

Spirit of the Lord would rest on the hoped-for Messiah for his

702-71 6 saving mission. 91 The descent of the Holy Spirit on Jesus at his
bap tism by John was the sign that this was he who was to come,
the Messiah, the Son of God. 92 He was conceived of the Holy Spirit;
his whole life and his whole mission are carried out in total com­
munion with the H oly Spirit whom the Father gives him "without
measure." 93

1287

This fullness of the Spirit was not to remain uniquely the

Messiah's, but was to be communica ted to the

w h o le m essia n ic

739 p e o p lt?4 On several occasions Christ p romised this outpouring of
the Spirit,95 a promise which he fulfilled first on Easter Sunday and
then more strikingly at Pentecost.96 Filled with the Holy Spirit the

apostles began to p roclaim "the mighty works of God," and Peter
declared this outpouring of the Spirit to be the sign of the messianic
age. 97 Those who believed in the apostolic preaching and were

baptized received the gift of the Holy Spirit in their tum.98

1288

"From that time on the apostles, in fulfillment of Christ's

will, imparted to the newly baptized by the laying on of hands the
gift of the Spirit that completes the grace of Baptism. For this reason

699 in the Letter to the Hebrews the doctrine concerning Bap tism and the
laying on of hands is listed among the first elements of Christian
instruction. The imposition of hands is rightly recognized by the
Catholic tradition as the origin of the sacrament of Confirmation,

which in a certain way perpetuates the grace of Pentecost in the
Church. "99

1289

327

Very early, the better to signify the gift of the Holy Spirit,

an anointing with perfumed oil

(chrism)

was added to the laying

695

on of hands. This anointing highlights the name "Christian," which
means "anointed" and derives from that of Christ himself whom
God "anointed with the Holy Spirit." 100 This rite of anointing has

436

continued ever since, in both East and West. For this reason the

Chrismation, anointing with
myron which means "chrism." In the West, the term 1297
Confirmation suggests that this sacrament both confirms bap tism
Eastern Churches call this sacrament

chrism, or

and strengthens bap tismal grace.

Two traditions: East and West
1290
In the first centuries Confirmation generally comprised one sin­
gle celebration with Baptism, forming with it a "double sacrament,"
according to the expression of St. Cyprian. Among other reasons, the
multiplication of infant baptisms all through the year, the increase of rural
parishes, and the growth of dioceses often prevented the bishop from
being present at all baptismal celebrations. In the West the desire to reserve
the completion of Baptism to the bishop caused the temporal separation
of the two sacraments. The East has kept them united, so that Confirmation
is conferred by the priest who ba tizes. But he can do so only with the
"myron" consecrated by a bishop. 01

�

1233

1291
A custom of the Roman Church facilitated the development of
the Western practice: a double anointing with sacred chrism after Baptism.
The first anointing of the neophyte on coming out of the baptismal bath
was performed by the priest; it was completed by a second anointing on
the forehead of the newly baptized by the bishop. 102 The first anointing
with sacred chrism, by the priest, has remained attached to the baptismal
rite; it signifies the participation of the one baptized in the prophetic,
priestly, and kingly offices of Christ. If Baptism is conferred on an adult,
there is only one post-baptismal anointing, that of Confirmation.

1 242

1292
The practice of the Eastern Churches gives greater emphasis to
the unity of Christian initiation. That of the Latin Church more clearly
expresses the communion of the new Christian with the bishop as guar­
antor and servant of the unity, catholicity and apostolicity of his Church,
and hence the connection with the apostolic origins of Christ's Church.

1244

II.

THE SIGNS AND THE RITE OF CONFIRMATION

1293

In treating the rite of Confirmation, it is fitting to consider the

sign of anointing and what it signifies and imprints: a spiritual seal.

99 Paul VI, Divinae consortium naturae, 659; cf. Acts 8:15-17; 19:5-6; Heb 6:2.
100 Acts 10:38.
101 Cf. CCEO, can. 695 § 1; 696 § 1 .
102 Cf. St. Hippolytus, Trad. Ap. 21: SCh 1 1, 80-95.

328

Part Two

Anointing, in Biblical and other ancient symbolism, is rich
in meaning: oil is a sign of abundance and joy}D2 it cleanses
(anointing before and after a bath) and limbers (the anointing of
athletes and wrestlers); oil is a sign of healing, since it is soothing
to bruises and wounds;1 03 and it makes radiant with beauty,
health, and strength.
Anointing with oil has all these meanings in the sacramen1 1 52 1294
tal life. The pre-baptismal anointing with the oil of catechumens
signifies cleansing and strengthening; the anointing of the sick
expresses healing and comfort. The post-baptismal anointing with
sacred chrism in Confirmation and ordination is the sign of conse­
cration . By Confirmation Christians, that is, those who are
anointed, share more completely in the mission of Jesus Christ and
the fullness of the Holy Spirit with which he is filled, so that their
lives may give off "the aroma of Christ." 104
695

By this anointing the confirmand receives the "mark," the
698 1295
seal of the Holy Spirit. A seal is a symbol of a person, a sign of personal
authority, or ownership of an object. 105 Hence soldiers were marked
with their leader's seal and slaves with their master's. A seal authen­
ticates a juridical act or document and occasionally makes it secret. 106
1296
Christ himself declared that he was marked with his Fa­
ther's seai.l07 Christians are also marked with a seal: "It is God who
121 establishes us with you in Christ and has commissioned us; he has
put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a
guarantee ." 108 This seal of the Holy Spirit marks our total belong­
ing to Christ, our enrollment in his service for ever, as well as the
promise of divine protection in the great eschatological triaP09
The celebration of Confirmation

1 1 83 1297
The consecration of the sacred chrism is an important action that
precedes the celebration of Confirmation, but is in a certain way a part
of it. It is the bishop who, in the course of the Chrism Mass of Holy
Thursday, consecrates the sacred chrism for his whole diocese. In
1 241 some Eastern Churches this consecration is even reserved to the
patriarch:
102 Cf. Deut 11:14; Pss 23:5; 104:15.
103 Cf. !sa 1:6; Lk 10:3 4.
104 2 Cor 2:15.
105 Cf. Gen 38:18; 4 1: 42; Deut 32:34; CT 8:6.
106 Cf. 1 Kings 21:8; Jer 32:10; !sa 29:11.
107 Cf. Jn 6:27.
108 2 Cor 1:21-22; cf. Eph 1:13; 4, 30.
109 Cf. Rev 7:2-3; 9: 4; Ezek 9:4-6.

329

The Celebration of the Christian Mystery
The liturgy of Antioch expresses the epiclesis for the consecra­
tion of the sacred chrism (myron) in this way: "[Father . . . send
your Holy Spirit] on us and on this oil which is before us and
consecrate it, so that it may be for all who are anointed and
marked with it holy myron, priestly myron, royal myron,
anointing with gladness, clothing with light, a cloak of salva­
tion, a spiritual gift, the sanctification of souls and bodies,
imperishable happiness, the indelible seal, a buckler of faith,
and a fearsome helmet against all the works of the adversary."

1298
When Confirmation is celebrated separately from Baptism, as is
the case in the Roman Rite, the Liturgy of Confirmation begins with the
renewal of baptismal promises and the profession of faith by the confir­
mands. This clearly shows that Confirmation follows Baptism. l 11 When
adults are baptized, they immediately receive Confirmation and partici­
pate in the Eucharist. 11 Z
1299

In the Roman Rite the bishop extends his hands over the

whole group of the confirmands. Since the time of the apos tles this
gesture has signified the gift of the Spirit. The bishop invokes the
outpouring of the Spirit in these words:

All-powerful God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
by water and the Holy Spirit
you freed your sons and daughters from sin
and gave them new life.
Send your Holy Spirit upon them
to be their helper and guide.
Give them the spirit of wisdom and understanding,
the spirit of right judgment and courage,
the spirit of knowledge and reverence.
Fill them with the spirit of wonder and awe in your presence.
We ask this through Christ our Lord. 113

1300

1831

The esse n tia l rite of the sacrament follows. In the Latin rite,

"the sacrament of Confirmation is conferred through the anointing
with chrism on the forehead, which is done by the laying on of the
hand, and through the words:

Sancti'

'Accipe signaculum doni Spiritus 699

[Be sealed with the Gift of the Holy Spirit . ] . " 1 14 In the

Eastern Churches of Byzantine rite, after a prayer of epiclesis, the
more significant parts of the body are anointed with myron: forehead, eyes, nose, ears, lips, chest, b ack, hands, and feet. Each
anointing is accomp anied by the formula

IlvEuua·roc 'Ayiou

THE EFFECTS oF CoNFIRMATION

1302

It is evident from its celebration tha t the effect of the

signifies and demons trates eccles ial communion with the bishop
and with all the fa ithfui. 116

sacrament of Confirmation is the special outpouring of the Holy

73 1

Spirit as once granted to the apostles on the day of Pentecost.

1262-1274 1303

From this fact, Confirmation brings an increase and deep-

ening of b aptismal grace:
- it roots us more deeply in the divine filiation which makes us cry,
"Abba! Father ! ";l 17
- it unites us more firmly to Christ;

- it increases the gifts of the Holy Spirit in us;

- it renders our bond with the Church more perfect;1 18
- it gives us a special strength of the Holy Spirit to spread and defend

2044

the faith by word and action as true witnesses of Christ, to confess the

name of Christ boldly, and never to be ashamed of the Cross: 1 19

Recall then that you have received the spiritual seal, the
spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of right judg­
ment and courage, the spirit of knowledge and reverence,
the spirit of holy fear in God's presence. Guard what you
have received. God the Father has marked you with his sign;
Christ the Lord has confirmed ou and has placed his
pledge, the Spirit, in your hearts. 1 0

Like Bap tism which it completes, Confirmation is given

only once, for it too imprints on the soul an

indelible spiritual mark,

the "character, " which is the sign that Jesus Chris t has marked a

Christian with the seal of his Spirit by clothing him with power

from on high so that he may be his witness . 121

1 268 1305

This "character" perfects the common priesthood of the

faithful, received in Baptism, and " the confirmed person receives

the power to profess faith in Christ publicly and as it were officially

(quasi ex officio) ."122

331

WHO CAN RECEIVE THIS SACRAMENT?

1306
Every baptized person not yet confirmed can and should
receive the sacrament of Confirmation. 123 Since Baptism, Confir­
mation, and Eucharist form a unity, it follows that "the faithful are 1 2 1 2
obliged t o receive this sacrament at the appropriate time," 124 for
without Confirmation and Eucharist, Baptism is certainly valid and
efficacious, but Christian initiation remains incomplete.
1307
For centuries, Latin custom has indicated "the age of discretion"
as the reference point for receiving Confirmation . But in danger of death
children should be confirmed even if they have not yet attained the age of
discretion. 125
1308
Although Confirmation is sometimes called the "sacra­
ment of Christian maturity," we must not confuse adult faith with
the adult age of natural growth, nor forget that the baptismal grace
is a grace of free, unmerited election and does not need "ratifica- 1 250
tion" to become effective. St. Thomas reminds us of this:
Age of body does not determine age of soul. Even in child­
hood man can attain spiritual maturity: as the book of Wis­
dom says: "For old age is not honored for length of time, or
measured by number of years. " Many children, through the
strength of the Holy Spirit they have received, have bravely
fought for Christ even to the shedding of their blood. 126

1309
Preparation for Confirmation should aim at leading the
Christian toward a more intimate union with Christ and a more
lively familiarity with the Holy Spirit - his actions, his gifts, and
his bid dings - in order to be more capable of assuming the apostolic
responsibilities of Christian life. To this end catechesis for Confir­
mation should strive to awaken a sense of belonging to the Church
of Jesus Christ, the universal Church as well as the parish commu­
nity. The latter bears special responsibility for the preparation of
confirmands . 127
1310
To receive Confirmation one must be in a state of grace.
One should receive the sacrament of Penance in order to be
cleansed for the gift of the Holy Spirit. More intense prayer should 2670
prepare one to receive the strength and graces of the Holy Spirit
with docility and readiness to act. 128

V.

THE MINI STER OF CO NFIRMATION

1312

The

1 233

original minister of Confirmation is the bishop . 130

In the East, ordinari ly the priest who bap tizes also immediately confers Confirmation in one and the same celebration. But
he does so with sacred chrism consecrated by the patriarch or the
bishop, thus expressing the apostolic unity of the Church whose
bonds are strengthened by the sacrament of Confirmation. In the
Latin Church, the same discipline applies to the Bap tism of adults
or to the reception into full communion with the Church of a person
bap tized in another Christian community that does not have valid
Confirmation. 131

1290 1313

In the Latin Rite,

the ordinary minister of Confirmation is

the bishop . 132 If the need arises, the bishop may grant the faculty
of administering Confirmation 133 to priests, although it is fitting
that he confer it himself, mindful that the celebration of Confirma­
tion has been temporally separated from Baptism for this reason.

Bishops are the successors of the apostles . They have received the
fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders. The administration of this
sacrament by them demonstrates clearly that its effect is to unite
those who receive it more closely to the Church, to her apostolic

1 285 origins, and to her mission of bearing witness to Christ.
If a Christian is in danger of death, any priest can give him
Confirmation. 134 Indeed the Church desires that none of her children,

1 307 1314

even the youngest, should depart this world without having been

perfected by the Holy Spirit with the gift of Christ's fullness.

not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been
bap tized in the name of the Lord jesus. Then they laid
their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit"

(Acts 8 :14-17) .

1316

Confirmation perfects Baptismal grace; it is the sacra­
ment which gives the Holy Spirit in order to root us
more deeply in the divine filiation, incorporate us
more firmly into Christ, strengthen our bond with the
Church, associate us more closely with her mission,
and help us bear witness to the Christian faith in words
accompanied by deeds.

1317

Confirmation, like Baptism, imprints a spiritual mark or
indelible character on the Christian's soul; for this reason

one can receive this sacrament only once

1318

in one's life.

In the East this sacrament is administered immediately
after Bap tism and is followed by participation in the
Eucharist; this tradition highlights the uni ty of the
three sacraments of Christian initiation. In the Latin
Church this sacrament is administered when the age
of reason has been reached, and its celebration is ordi­
narily reserved to the bishop, thus signifying that this
sacrament strengthens the ecclesial bond .

1319

A candidate for Confirmation who has attained the
age of reason must profess the faith, be in the state of
grace, have the intention of receiving the sacrament,
and be prepared to assume the role of disciple and

witness to Christ, both wi thin the ecclesial community
and in temporal affairs .

1320

The essential rite of Confirmation is anointing the forehead

of the baptized with sacred chrism (in the East other sense­
organs as well), together with the laying on of the minister's

hand and the words: "Accipe signaculum doni Spiritus Sancti"

(Be sealed with the Gift of the Holy Spirit.)

in the Roman

rite, or: Signaculum doni Spiritus Sancti (the seal of the gift of
the Holy Spirit) in the Byzantine rite.

1321

When Confirmation is celebrated separately from
Bap tism, its connection with Baptism is expressed,
among other ways, by the renewal of baptismal prom­
ises . The celebration of Confirmation during the
Eucharist helps underline the unity of the sacraments
of Christian initia tion.

334

A RTICLE 3
THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST

1212 1322

The holy Eucharis t completes Christian initiation. Those

who have been raised to the digni ty of the royal priesthood by
Bap tism and configured more deeply to Chris t by Confirmation

participate with the whole community in the Lord's own sacrifice
by means of the Eucharis t.

1323

"At the Last Supper, on the night he was betrayed, our

Savior ins tituted the Eucharis tic sacrifice of his Body and Blood .
This he did in order to perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross through­
out the ages until he should come again, and so to entrust to his
beloved Spouse, the Church, a memorial of his death and resurrec­
tion: a sacrament of love, a sign of uni ty, a bond of charity, a Paschal

and a pledge of future glory is given to us."' 1 35

I.
864 1324

THE EUCHARIST - SOURCE AND SUMMIT
OF ECCLESIAL LIFE
The Eucharist is "the source and summi t of the Christian

life." 1 36 "The other sacraments, and indeed all ecclesiastical ministries
and works of the apostolate, are bound up with the Eucharist and are

oriented toward it. For in the blessed Eucharist is contained the whole

spiritual good of the Church, namely Christ himself, our Pasch." 1 37

1325

"The Eucharist is the efficacious sign and sublime cause of

that communion in the divine life and that unity of the People of God

775 by which the Church is kept in being. It is the culmination both of
God's action sanc tifying the world in Christ and of the worship men
offer to Christ and through him to the Father in the Holy Spirit." 138

1090 1326

Finally, by the Eucharistic celebration we already unite

ourselves with the heavenly liturgy and anticipate eternal life,
when God will be all in al1. 139

1 124

1327

In b rief, the Eucharist is the sum and summary of our faith:

"Our way of thinking is attuned to the Eucharist, and the Eucharist

WHAT Is THIS SACRAMENT CALLED?

The inexhaustible richness of this sacrament is expressed

in the different names we give it . Each name evokes certain aspects
of it. It is called :

2637
1 082
blessings that proclaim - especially d uring a meal - God's works: 1359
Eucharist, because it is an action of thanksgiving to G o d .

The Greek words

eucharistein 141

and

eulogein 142

recall the Jewish

creation, redemp tion, and sanctification.

1329

The Lord's Supper, because of its connection with the

1382

supper which the Lord took with his disciples on the eve of his
Passion and because it anticipates the wedding feast of the Lamb

in the heavenly Jerusalem. 143
The

Break ing of Bread, because Jesus used this rite, part of

a Jewish meal, when as master of the table he blessed and distrib­
uted the bread, 144 above all at the Last Supper. 145 It is by this action
that his disciples will recognize him after his Resurrection, 146 and

it is this expression that the first Christians will use to designate

their Eucharistic assemblies; 147 by doing so they signified that all

790

who eat the one broken bread, Chris t, enter into communion with
him and form but one body in him. 148
The

Eucha ris tic asse m b ly (synaxis), because

the Eucharist

The

it is the Sacrament of sacraments. The Eucharistic species reserved

in the tabernacle are designa ted by this same name .
950 1331

Holy Communion, because by this sacrament we uni te our-

selves to Christ, who makes us sharers in his Body and Blood to
form a single body. 151 We also call it: the holy things (ta hagia;

948 sancta) 152 - the first meaning of the phrase "communion of saints"
1405 in the Apostles' Creed - the bread ofangels, breadfrom heaven, medicine

of immortality, 1 53 viaticum . . . .
1332

Holy Mass (Missa), because the liturgy in which the mystery

of salvation is accomplished concludes with the sending forth (missio)

of the faithful, so that they may fulfill God's will in their daily lives.

THE EUCHARIST IN THE ECONOMY OF SALVATION

The signs of bread and wine
1 350 1333

At the heart of the Eucharistic celebration are the bread and wine

that, by the words of Christ and the invocation of the Holy Spirit, become
Christ's Body and Blood. Faithful to the Lord's command the Church
continues to do, in his memory and until his glorious return, what he did
on the eve of his Passion: "He took bread. . . . " "He took the cup filled
with wine. . . . " The signs of bread and wine become, in a way surpassing
understanding, the Body and Blood of Christ; they continue also to
signify the goodness of creation. Thus in the Offertory we give thanks to

1 1 47 the Creator for bread and wine,154 fruit of the "work of human hands,"
but above all as "fruit of the earth" and "of the vine" - gifts of the Creator.

1 1 48 The Church sees in the gesture of the king-priest Melchizedek, who
"brought out bread and wine," a prefiguring of her own offering. 155

1 1 50 1334

In

the Old Covenant bread and wine were offered in

sacrifice among the first fruits of the earth as a sign of grateful
acknowledgment to the Creator. But they also received a new

1363 significance in the context of the Exodus: the unleavened bread that
Israel eats every year at Passover commemorates the haste of the
departure that liberated them from Egypt; the remembrance of the
manna in the desert will always recall to Israel that it lives by the
bread of the Word of God; 156 their daily bread is the fruit of the
promised land, the pledge of God's faithfulness to his promises .

The Celebration of the Christian Mystery

337

The "cup of blessing" 157 at the end of the Jewish Passover meal
adds to the fes tive joy of wine an eschatological dimension: the
messianic expectation of the rebuild ing of Jerusalem . When Jesus
instituted the Eucharis t, he gave a new and definitive meaning to
the blessing of the bread and the cup.

1335

The miracles of the multiplica tion of the loaves, when the 1 1 51

Lord says the blessing, breaks and dis tributes the loaves through
his disciples to feed the multitude, prefigure the superabundance
of this unique bread of his Eucharist. 158 The sign of water turned
into wine at Cana already announces the Hour of Jesus' glorification. It makes manifest the fulfillment of the wedding feast in the
Father's kingdom, where the faithfu l will d rink the new wine that
has become the Blood of Christ. 159

1336

The first announcement of the Eucharist divided the disci­

ples, just as the announcement of the Passion scandalized them: "This
is a hard saying; who Cru'1 listen to it?" 160 The Eucharist and the Cross
are stumbling blocks. It is the same mystery and it never ceases to be
an occasion of division. "Will you also go away?": 161 the Lord's
question echoes through the ages, as a loving invitation to discover
that only he has "the words of eternal life" 162 and that to receive in faith

the gift of his Eucharist is to receive the Lord himself

1327

The institution of the Eucharist

1337

The Lord, having loved those who were his own, loved

610

them t o the end . Knowing that the hour had come t o leave this
world and return to the Father, in the course of a meal he washed
their feet and gave them the commandment of love. 163 In order to
leave them a pledge of this love, in order never to depart from his
own and to make them sharers in his Passover, he institu ted the
Eucharist as the memorial of his death and Resurrection, and
commanded his apostles to celeb rate it until his re turn; " thereby
61 1
he cons tituted them priests of the New Testament . " 164

1338
The three synoptic Gospels and St. Paul have handed on to us the
account of the institution of the Eucharist; St. John, for his part, reports the
words of Jesus in the synagogue of Capernaum that prepare for the

institution of the Eucharist: Christ calls himself the bread of life, come
l
down from heaven. 65

1 1 69 1339

Jesus chose the time of Passover to fulfill what he had an-

nounced at Capemaum: giving his disciples his Body and his Blood:
Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the
passover lamb had to be sacrificed. So Jesus sent Peter and
John, saying, "Go and prepare the passover meal for us, that
we may eat it. . . . " They went . . . and prepared the passover.
And when the hour came, he sat at table, and the apostles
with him. And he said to them, "I have earnestly desired to eat
this passover with you before I suffer; for I tell you I shall not
eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God." . . . . And
he took bread, and when he had given thanks he broke it and
gave it to them, saying, "This is my body which is given for
you. Do this in remembrance of me." And likewise the cup
after supper, saying, "This cup which is poured out for you
l66
is the New Covenant in my blood."

1340

By celebrating the Last Supper with his apostles in the course

of the Passover meal, Jesus gave the Jewish Passover its definitive

1 15 1 meaning. Jesus' passing over to his father by his death and Resurrec­

tion, the new Passover, is anticipated in the Supper and celebrated in

the Eucharist, which

fulfills the Jewish Passover and

anticipates the

677 final Passover of the Church in the glory of the kingdom.

"Do this in memory of me"
61 1 1341

The command of Jesus to repeat his actions and words "until

he comes" does not only ask us to remember Jesus and what he did.

It is directed at the liturgical celebration, by the apostles and their

1 363 successors, of the memorial of Christ, of his life, of his death, of his
Resurrection, and of his intercession in the presence of the Father. 167

2624 1342

From the beginnin g the Church has been faithful to the

Lord's command . Of the Church of Jerusalem it is written:
They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellow­
ship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers . . . . Day by day,
attending the temple together and breaking bread in their
homes, they partook of food with glad and generous hearts. 168

1 1 66, 2 1 77 1343

It was above all on " the first day of the week," Sunday, the

day of Jesus' resurrection, that the Christians met "to break
bread . " 169 From that time on down to our own day the celebration

of the Eucharist has been continued so that today we encounter it
everywhere in the Church with the same fundamental structure. It
remains the center of the Church's life.

1344

Thus from celebration to celebration, as they proclaim the

Paschal mystery of Jesus "until he comes," the pilgrim People of
God advances, "following the na rrow way of the cross," 17 0 tow ard
the heavenly banquet, when all the elect will be seated at the table
of the kingdom.

IV.

THE LITURGICAL CELEBRATION OF THE EUCHARIST

The Mass of all ages
1345

As

early as the second century we have the witness of St.

Justin Martyr for the basic lines of the order of the Eucharistic celebra­
tion. They have stayed the same until our own day for all the great
liturgical families. St. Justin wrote to the pagan emperor Antoninus
Pius

(138-161) around the year 155, explaining what Christians did:
On the day we call the day of the sun, all who dwell in the
city or country gather in the same place.
The memoirs of the apostles and the writings of the prophets
are read, as much as time permits.
When the reader has finished, he who presides over those
gathered admonishes and challenges them to imitate these
beautiful things.
Then we all rise together and offer prayers* for ourselves . . .
and for all others, wherever they may be, so that we may be
found righteous by our life and actions, and faithful to the
commandments, so as to obtain eternal salvation.
When the prayers are concluded we exchange the kiss.
Then someone brings bread and a cup of water and wine
mixed together to him who presides over the brethren.
He takes them and offers praise and glory to the Father of
the universe, through the name of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit and for a considerable time he gives thanks (in Greek:
eucharistian) that we have been judged worthy of these gifts.
When he has concluded the prayers and thanksgivings, all
present give voice to an acclamation by saying: 'Amen.'
When he who presides has given thanks and the people have
responded, those whom we call deacons give to those pre­
sent the "eucharisted" bread, wine and water and take them
7
to those who are absent. 1 1

Part Two

1346
The liturgy of the Eucharist unfolds according to a funda­
mental structure which has been preserved throughout the centu­
ries down to our own day. It displays two great parts that form a
fundamental unity:
- the gathering, the liturgy of the Word, with readings, homily, and
general intercessions;
- the liturgy of the Eucharist, with the presentation of the bread
and wine, the consecratory thanksgiving, and communion.
The liturgy of the Word and liturgy of the Eucharist together
form "one single act of worship"; 172 the Eucharistic table set for us is
103 the table both of the Word of God and of the Body of the LordP3
Is this not the same movement as the Paschal meal of the
risen Jesus with his disciples? Walking with them he explained the
Scriptures to them; sitting with them at table "he took bread,
blessed and broke it, and gave it to them."l 74

1347

The movement of the celebration
1348

All gather together. Christians come together in one place

for the Eucharistic assembly. At its head is Christ himself, the
1 1 40 principal agent of the Eucharist. He is high priest of the New
Covenant; it is he himself who presides invisibly over every
Eucharistic celebration. It is in representing him that the bishop or
1548 priest acting in the person of Christ the head (in persona Christi capitis)
presides over the assembly, speaks after the readings, receives the
offerings, and says the Eucharistic Prayer. All have their own active
parts to play in the celebration, each in his own way: readers, those
who bring up the offerings, those who give communion, and the
whole people whose "Amen" manifests their participation.
1 1 84 1349
The Liturgy of the Wo rd includes "the writings of the
prophets," that is, the Old Testament, and " the memoirs of the
apostles" (their letters and the Gospels). After the homily, which is
an exhortation to accept this Word as what it truly is, the Word of
God, 175 and to put it into practice, come the intercessions for all
men, according to the Apostle's words: "I urge that supplications,
prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men, for
kings, and all who are in high positions."l 76

The

p resenta tio n of the offe rings

(the Offertory) . Then,

sometimes in procession, the bread and wine are brought to the
altar; they will be offered by the priest in the name of Christ in the
Eucharistic sacrifice in which they will become his body and blood .
It is the very action of Christ at the Last Supper - " taking the bread
and a cup." "The Chu rch alone offers this pure oblation to the
Creator, when she offers what comes forth from his creation with
thanksgiving." 1 77 The presentation of the offerings at the altar

1359

takes up the gesture of Melchizedek and commits the Creator's
gifts into the hands of Chris t who, in his sacrifice, brings to perfec-

614

tion all human attempts to offer sacrifices .

1351

From the very beginning Christians have brought, along

with the bread and wine for the Eucharist, gifts to share with those
in need. This custom of the

collection, ever appropriate,

is inspired

by the example of Christ who became poor to make us rich: 1 78

1 397
2 1 86

Those who are well off, and who are also willing, give as
each chooses. What is gathered is given to him who presides
to assist orphans and widows, those whom illness or any
other cause has deprived of resources, risoners, immi­
grants and, in a word, all who are in need. 79

�

1352

The

anaphora:

with the Eucharistic Prayer - the prayer of

thanksgiving and consecration - we come to the heart and summit
of the celebration:
In the p reface, the Church gives thanks to the Father, through
Christ, in the Holy Spirit, for all his works: creation, redemption, and sancti­
fication. The whole community thus joins in the unending praise that the
Church in heaven, the angels and all the saints, sing to the thrice-holy God.

559

1353

In the epiclesis, the Church asks the Father to send his Holy Spirit
(or the power of his blessing180) on the bread and wine, so that by his
power they may become the body and blood of Jesus Christ and so that
those who take part in the Eucharist may be one body and one spirit (some
liturgical traditions put the epiclesis after the anamnesis).

1 1 05

In the institution narrative, the power of the words and the action
of Christ, and the power of the Holy Spirit, make sacramentally present
under the species of bread and wine Christ's body and blood, his sacrifice
offered on the cross once for all.

13 75

In the a na m nesis that follows, the Church calls to mind the
Passion, resurrection, and glorious return of Christ Jesus; she presents to
the Father the offering of his Son which reconciles us with him.

Part Two

In the intercessions, the Church indicates that the Eucharist is
celebrated in communion with the whole Church in heaven and on earth,
the living and the dead, and in communion with the pastors of the Church,
the Pope, the diocesan bishop, his presbyterium and his deacons, and all
the bishops of the whole world together with their Churches.

1382 1355
In the communion, preceded by the Lord 's prayer and the
breaking o f the bread, the faithful receive "the bread of heaven"
and "the cup of salvation," the body and blood of Christ who
offered himself "for the life of the world": 181
1 32 7

Because this bread and wine have been made Eucharist
(" eucharisted," according to an ancient expression), "we call
this food Eucharist, and no one may take part in it unless he
believes that what we teach is true, has received baptism for
the forgiveness of sins and new birth, and lives in keeping
with what Christ taught." 182

v.

THE SACRAMENTAL SACRIFICE: THANKSGIVING,
MEMORIAL, PRESENCE

1356
If from the beginning Christians have celebrated the
Eucharist and in a form whose substance has not changed despite
the great diversity of times and liturgies, it is because we know
ourselves to be bound by the command the Lord gave on the eve
of his Passion: "Do this in remembrance of me. " 183
1357
We carry out this command of the Lord by celebrating the
memorial ofhis sacrifice. In so doing, we offer to the Father what he has

himself given us: the gifts of his creation, bread and wine which,
by the power of the Holy Spirit and by the words of Christ, have
become the body and blood of Christ. Christ is thus really and
mysteriously made present.

1358
We must therefore consider the Eucharist as:
- thanksgiving and praise to the Father;
- the sacrificial memorial of Christ and his Body;
- the presence of Christ by the power of his word and of his Spirit.
Thanksgiving and praise to the Father
1359
The Eucharist, the sacrament of our salvation accomplished
293 by Christ on the cross, is also a sacrifice of praise in thanksgiving for
the work of creation. In the Eucharistic sacrifice the whole of creation

183 1 Cor 11:24-25.

The Celebration of the Christian Mystery

343

loved by God is presented to the Father through the death and the
Resurrection of Christ. Through Christ the Church can offer the

sacrifice of praise in thanksgiving for all that God has made good,

beautiful, and just in creation and in humanity.

1360

The Eucharist is a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the Father, a

1 083

blessing by which the Church expresses her gratitude to God for
all his benefits, for all that he has accomplished through creation,

redemp tion, and sanctifica tion. Eucharis t means first of all
"thanksgiving."

1361

The Eucharist is also the sacrifice of praise by which the

Church sings the glory of God in the name of all crea tion . This

sacrifice of praise is possible only through Christ: he unites the

294

faithful to his person, to his praise, and to his intercession, so that

the sacrifice of praise to the Father is offered through Christ and with

him to be accepted
,

in him

.

The sacrificial memorial of Christ and o f his Body, the Church
1362

The Eucharist is the memorial of Christ's Passover, the

making present and the sacramental offering of his unique sacrifice, in the liturgy of the Church which is his Body.

In

all the

Eucharistic Prayers we find after the words of institution a prayer
called the anamnesis or memorial.

1363

In the sense of Sacred Scripture the memorial is

1 1 03
not merely

1 099

the recollection of past events but the proclamation of the mighty
works wrought by God for men. 184 In the liturgical celebration of
these events, they become in a certain way present and real. This is

how Israel understands its liberation from Egypt: every time Passover is celebrated, the Exodus events are made present to the
memory of believers so that they may conform their lives to them.

1364

In the New Testament, the memorial takes on new meaning.

When the Church celebrates the Eucharist, she commemorates Christ's

Passover, and it is made present: the sacrifice Christ offered once for all
on the cross remains ever present. 185 "As often as the sacrifice of the

61 1
1 085

Because it is the memorial of Christ's Passover, the Eucha-

2 1 00

Cross by which 'Christ our Pasch has been sacrificed' is celebrated on
the altar, the work of our redemption is carried out." 186

1365

rist is also a sacrifice. The sacrificial character of the Eucharist is

manifested in the very words of institution: "This is m y b ody which

184 Cf. Ex 13 : 3 .
18 5 Cf. Heb 7:25-27.
1 86 LG 3; cf. 1 Cor 5: 7.

344

Part Two

is given for you " and "This cup which is poured out for you is the
New Covenant in my blood ." 187 In the Eucharis t Christ gives us
the very body which he gave up for us on the cross, the very blood

1 846 which he "poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins . " 188
613 1366

The Eucharist is thus a sacrifice because it

re-presents
memorial

(makes p resent) the sacrifice of the cross, because it is its
and because it applies i ts fruit:

[Christ], our Lord and God, was once and for all to offer
himself to God the Father by his death on the altar of the
cross, to accomplish there an everlasting redemption. But
because his priesthood was not to end with his death, at the
Last Supper "on the night when he was betrayed," [he
wanted] to leave to his beloved spouse the Church a visible
sacrifice (as the nature of man demands) by which the
bloody sacrifice which he was to accomplish once for all on
the cross would be re-presented, its memory perpetuated
until the end of the world, and its salutary power be applied
l
to the forgiveness of the sins we daily commit. 89

1 545 1367

The sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Eucharist are

one single sacrifice:

"The victim is one and the same: the same now

offers through the ministry of priests, who then offered himself on
the cross; only the manner of offering is different . " "And since in
this divine sacrifice which is celebrated in the Mass, the same Christ
who offered himself once in a bloody manner on the altar of the
cross is contained and offered in an unbloody manner . . . this
sacrifice is truly propitiatory ." 190

1368

The

Eucharist is also the sacrifice of the Church.

The Church

which is the Body of Christ participates in the offering of her Head.

With him, she herself is offered whole and entire. She unites herself
to his intercession with the Father for all men . In the Eucharist the
sacrifice of Christ becomes also the sacrifice of the members of

his

6 1 8 Body. The lives of the faithful, their praise, sufferings, prayer, and
2031 work, are united with those of Christ and with his total offering, and
1 1 09 so acquire a new value. Christ's sacrifice present on the altar makes it
possible for all generations of Christians to be united with his offering.
In the catacombs the Church is often represented as a woman in
prayer, arms outstretched in the praying position. Like Christ who
stretched out his arms on the cross, through him, with him, and in him,
she offers herself and intercedes for all men.

The Celebration of the Christian Mystery

1369
The whole Church is united with the offering and intercession of
Christ. Since he has the ministry of Peter in the Chu rch, the Pope is
associated with every celebration of the Eucharist, wherein he is

834, 882

named as the sign and servant of the unity of the universal Church .
The

bishop of the place is always responsible for the Eucharist, even
priest presides; the bishop' s name is mentioned to signify 1561, 1566

when a

his presidency over the particular Church, in the midst of his
presbyterium and with the assistance of

deacons.

The community

intercedes also for all ministers who, for it and with it, offer the
Eucharistic sacrifice:
Let only that Eucharist be regarded as legitimate, which is
celebrated under [the presidency of] the bishop or him to
whom he has entrusted it. 191
Through the ministry of priests the spiritual sacrifice of the
faithful is completed in union with the sacrifice of Christ the
only Mediator, which in the Eucharist is offered through the
priests' hands in the name of the whole Church in an unbloody
and sacramental manner until the Lord himself comes. 192

1370

To the offering of Christ are united not only the members

still here on earth, but also those already

in the glory of heaven .

In

communion with and commemorating the Blessed Virgin Mary
and all the saints, the Church offers the Eucharistic sacrifice .

956

In the 969

Eucharist the Church is as it were at the foot of the cross with Mary,
united with the offering and intercession of Christ.

1371
The Eucharistic sacrifice is also offered for the faithful de- 958, 1 689
parted who "have died in Christ but are not yet wholly purified," 193 1 032
so tha t they may be able to enter into the light and peace of Christ:
Put this body anywhere! Don't trouble yourselves about it!
I simply ask you to remember me at the Lord's altar wher­
1
ever you are. 94
Then, we pray [in the anaphora] for the holy fathers and
bishops who have fallen asleep, and in general for all who
have fallen asleep before us, in the belief that it is a great
benefit to the souls on whose behalf the supplication is
offered, while the holy and tremendous Victim is present. . . .
By offering to God our supplications for those who have
fallen asleep, if they have sinned, we . . . offer Christ sacri­
ficed for the sins of all, and so render favorable, for them and
l
for us, the God who loves man. 95

St. Augustine admirably summed up this doctrine that
moves us to an ever more complete participation in our Redeemer's
1 1 40 sacrifice which we celebrate in the Eucharist:

1372

This wholly redeemed city, the assembly and society of the
saints, is offered to God as a universal sacrifice by the high priest
who in the form of a slave went so far as to offer himself for us
in his Passion, to make us the Body of so great a head. . . . Such
is the sacrifice of Christians: "we who are many are one Body in
Christ." The Church continues to reproduce this sacrifice in the
sacrament of the altar so well-known to believers wherein it is
evident to them that in what she offers she herself is offered . 196

The presence of Christ by the power of his word and the Holy Spirit
1373
"Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised from the dead,
who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us," is
present in many ways to his Church: 197 in his word, in his Church's
prayer, "where two or three are gathered in my name," 198 in the poor,
the sick, and the imprisoned, 199 in the sacraments of which he is the
author, in the sacrifice of the Mass, and in the person of the minister.
1 088 But "he is present . . . most especially in the Eucharistic species." 200

cies is unique. It raises the Eucharist above all the sacraments as
1 2 1 1 "the perfection o f the spiritual life and the end t o which all the
sacraments tend ." 201 In the most blessed sacrament of the Eucharist
"the body and blood, together with the soul and divinity, of our
Lord Jesus Christ and, therefore, the whole Christ is truly, really, and
substantially contained."202 "This presence is called 'real' - by
which is not intended to exclude the other types of presence as if
they could not be 'real' too, but because it is presence in the fullest
sense: that is to say, it is a substantial presence by which Christ, God
and man, makes himself wholly and entirely present. "203
1375
It is by the conversion of the bread and wine into Christ's
1 1 05 body and blood that Christ becomes present in this sacrament. The
Church Fathers strongly affirmed the faith of the Church in the
efficacy of the Word of Christ and of the action of the Holy Spirit
to bring about this conversion. Thus St. John Chrysostom declares:

The Celebration of the Christian Mystery

It is not man that causes the things offered to become the
Body and Blood of Christ, but he who was crucified for us,
Christ himself. The priest, in the role of Christ, pronounces
these words, but their power and grace are God's. This is m
body, he says. This word transforms the things offered. 20

/

1 1 28

And St. Ambrose says about this conversion:
Be convinced that this is not what nature has formed, but what
the blessing has consecrated. The power of the blessing prevails
over that of nature, because by the blessing nature itself is
changed . . . . Could not Christ's word, which can make from
nothing what did not exist, change existing things into what
they were not before? It is no less a feat to ve things their
original nature than to change their nature.20

r

298

1376
The Council of Trent summarizes the Catholic faith by
declaring: "Because Christ our Redeemer said that it was truly his
body that he was offering under the species of bread, it has always
been the conviction of the Church of God, and this holy C ouncil
now declares again, that by the consecration of the bread and wine
there takes place a change of the whole substance of the bread into
the substance of the body of Christ our Lord and of the whole
substance of the wine into the substance of his blood. This change
the holy Catholic Church has fittingly and properly called transub­
stantiation." 206
1377
The Eucharistic presence of Christ begins at the moment
of the consecration and endures as long as the Eucharistic species
subsist. Christ is present whole and entire in each of the species and
whole and entire in each of their parts, in such a way that the
breaking of the bread does not divide Christ. 207
1378
Worship of the Eucharist. In the liturgy of the Mass we express 1 1 78
our faith in the real presence of Christ under the species of bread and
wine by, among other ways, genuflecting or bowing deeply as a sign
of adoration of the Lord. "The Catholic Church has always offered 1 03
and still offers to the sacrament of the Eucharist the cult of adoration, 2628
not only during Mass, but also outside of it, reserving the consecrated
hosts with the utmost care, exposing them to the solemn veneration
of the faithful, and carrying them in procession."2 08

The tabernacle was first intended for the reservation of the Eucharist
in a worthy place so that it could be brought to the sick and those absent,
outside of Mass. As faith in the real presence of Christ in his Eucharist
deepened, the Church became conscious of the meaning of silent adoration
of the Lord present under the Eucharistic species. It is for this reason that the
tabernacle should be located in an especially worthy place in the church and
should be constructed in such a way that it emphasizes and manifests the truth
2691 of the real presence of Christ in the Blessed Sacrament.

1380
It is highly fitting that Christ should have wanted to re­
main present to his Church in this unique way. Since Christ was
about to take his departure from his own in his visible form, he
wanted to give us his sacramental presence; since he was about to
669 offer himself on the cross to save us, he wanted us to have the
memorial of the love with which he loved us " to the end,"209 even
to the giving of his life. In his Eucharistic presence he remains
mysteriously in our midst as the one who loved us and gave
478 himself up for us,210 and he remains under signs that express and
communicate this love:
The Church and the world have a great need for Eucharistic
worship. Jesus awaits us in this sacrament of love. Let us not
refuse the time to go to meet him in adoration, in contemplation
full of faith, and open to making amends for the serious offenses
and crimes of the world. Let our adoration never cease.2 1 1

"That in this sacrament are the true Body of Christ and his
true Blood is something that 'cannot be apprehended by the
156 senses,' says St. Thomas, 'but only by faith, which relies on divine
215 authority.' For this reason, in a commentary on Luke 22:19 ('This is
my body which is given for you. '), St. Cyril says: 'Do not doubt
whether this is true, but rather receive the words of the Savior in
faith, for since he is the truth, he cannot lie. "'212

1381

Godhead here in hiding, whom I do adore
Masked by these bare shadows, shape and nothing more,
See, Lord, at thy service low lies here a heart
Lost, all lost in wonder at the God thou art.
Seeing, touching, tasting are in thee deceived;
How says trusty hearing? that shall be believed;
What God's Son has told me, take for truth I do;
Truth himself speaks truly or there's nothing true. 213

THE PASCHAL BANQUET

1382
The Mass is at the same time, and inseparably, the sacrifi­
cial memorial in which the sacrifice of the cross is perpetuated and
the sacred banquet of communion with the Lord's body and blood .
But the celebration of the Eucharistic sacrifice is wholly directed
toward the intimate union of the faithful with Christ through
communion. To receive communion is to receive Christ himself
950
who has offered himself for us.
1383
The altar, around which the Church is gathered in the 1 1 82
celebration of the Eucharist, represents the two aspects of the same
mystery: the altar of the sacrifice and the table of the Lord . This is
all the more so since the Christian altar is the symbol of Christ
himself, present in the midst of the assembly of his faithful, both as
the victim offered for our reconciliation and as food from heaven
who is giving himself to us. "For what is the altar of Christ if not
the image of the Body of Christ?"2 14 asks St. Ambrose. He says
elsewhere, "The altar represents the body [of Christ] and the Body
of Christ is on the altar."2 15 The liturgy expresses this unity of
sacrifice and communion in many prayers . Thus the Roman
Church prays in its anaphora:
We entreat you, almighty God,
that by the hands of your holy Angel
this offering may be borne to your altar in heaven
in the sight of your divine majesty,
so that as we receive in communion at this altar
the most holy Body and Blood of your Son,
we may be filled with every heavenly blessing and grace. 216

"Take this and eat it, all of you": communion
1384

The Lord addresses an invitation to us, urging us to receive 2835

him in the sacrament of the Eucharist: "Truly, I say to you, unless

you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have
no life in you."2 17

omni benedictione co:elesti et gratia repleamur.

2 17 Jn 6:53.

350

Part Two

1385
To respond to this invitation we must prepare ourselves for
so great and so holy a moment. St. Paul urges us to examine our
conscience: "Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or d rinks the cup
of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the
body and blood of the Lord . Let a man examine himself, and so eat
of the bread and drink of the cup. For any one who eats and drinks
without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon him1 457 self." 21 8 Anyone conscious of a grave sin must receive the sacra­
ment of Reconciliation before coming to communion.
1386
Before so great a sacrament, the faithful can only echo
humbly and with ardent faith the words of the Centurion:

"Do m ine, n o n sum d ignus ut intres sub tectum m e u m , sed tantum
d ie ve rba, e t sanab itur anima mea" ("Lord, I am not worthy that you

should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul
will be healed .").219 And in the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysos­
tom the faithful pray in the same spirit:
0 Son of God, bring me into communion today with your
mystical supper. I shall not tell your enemies the secret, nor
kiss you with Judas' kiss. But like the good thief I cry, "Jesus,
remember me when you come into your kingdom."

732

To prepare for worthy reception of this sacrament, the faithful
1387
should observe the fast required in their Church. 220 Bodily demeanor
2043 (gestures, clothing) ought to convey the respect, solemnity, and joy of this
moment when Christ becomes our guest.

It is in keeping with the very meaning of the Eucharist that
the faithful, if they have the required dispositions,221 receive com­
munion when they participate in the Mass.222 As the Second Vatican
Council says: "That more perfect form of participation in the Mass
whereby the faithful, after the priest's communion, receive the
Lord's Body from the same sacrifice, is warmly recommended."223

1388

2042 1389
The Church obliges the faithful to take part in the Divine
Liturgy on Sundays and feast days and, prepared by the sacrament
of Reconciliation, to receive the Eucharist at least once a year, if
possible during the Easter season.224 But the Church strongly
encourages the faithful to receive the holy Eucharist on Sundays
2837 and feast days, or more often s till, even daily.

The Celebration of the Christian Mystery

351

1390
Since Christ is sacramentally present under each of the
species, communion under the species of bread alone makes it
possible to receive all the fruit of Eucharistic grace. For pastoral
reasons this manner of receiving communion has been legitimately
established as the most common form in the La tin rite. But "the
sign of communion is more complete when given under both
kinds, since in that form the sign of the Eucharistic meal appears
more clearly."225 This is the usual form of receiving communion in
the Eastern rites .
The fruits of Holy Communion
1391
Holy Communion augments our union with Christ. The prin­
cipal fruit of receiving the Eucharist in Holy Communion is an
intimate union with Christ Jesus. Indeed, the Lord said: "He who 460
eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him."226
Life in Christ has its foundation in the Eucharistic banquet: "As the
living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who
521
eats me will live because of me."227
On the feasts of the Lord, when the faithful receive the Body
of the Son, they proclaim to one another the Good News that
the first fruits of life have been given, as when the angel said
to Mary Magdalene, "Christ is risen! " Now too are life and
resurrection conferred on whoever receives Christ. 228

1392
What material food produces in our bodily life, Holy Com- 1212
munion wonderfully achieves in our spiritual life. Communion
with the flesh of the risen Christ, a flesh "given life and giving life
through the Holy Spirit," 229 preserves, increases, and renews the
life of grace received at Baptism. This growth in Christian life needs
the nourishment of Eucharistic Communion, the bread for our
pilgrimage until the moment of death, when it will be given to us
as viaticum.
1524
1393
Holy Communion separates us from sin . The body of Christ
we receive in Holy Communion is "given up for us," and the blood
we drink "shed for the many for the forgiveness of sins." For this
reason the Eucharist cannot unite us to Christ withou t at the same 613
time cleansing us from past sins and preserving us from future sins:

Part Two
For as often as we eat this bread and drink the cup, we
proclaim the death of the Lord. If we proclaim the Lord's
death, we proclaim the forgiveness of sins. If, as often as his
blood is poured out, it is poured for the forgiveness of sins,
I should always receive it, so that it may always forgive mJb
sins. Because I always sin, I should always have a remedy. 2

As bodily nourishment restores lost strength, so the Eucha­
rist strengthens our charity, which tends to be weakened in daily
1 863 life; and this living charity wipes away venial sins. 23 1 By giving
1 436 himself to us Christ revives our love and enables us to break our
disordered attachments to creatures and root ourselves in him:

1394

Since Christ died for us out of love, when we celebrate the
memorial of his death at the moment of sacrifice we ask that
love may be granted to us by the coming of the Holy Spirit.
We humbly pray that in the strength of this love by which
Christ willed to die for us, we, by receiving the gift of the
Holy Spirit, may be able to consider the world as crucified
for us, and to be ourselves as crucified to the world . . . .
Having received the gift of love, let us die to sin and live for
God. 232

1395
By the same charity that it enkindles in us, the Eucharist
preserves us from future mortal sins. The more we share the life of

1 855 Christ and progress in his friendship, the more difficult it is to break
away from him by mortal sin. The Eucharist is not ordered to the
forgiveness of mortal sins - that is proper to the sacrament of
1 446 Reconciliation. The Eucharist is properly the sacrament of those
who are in full communion with the Church.
1 1 1 8 1396
The unity of the Mystical Body: the Eucharist makes the Church.
Those who receive the Eucharist are united more closely to Christ.
Through it Christ unites them to all the faithful in one body - the
Church. Communion renews, strengthens, and deepens this incor­
poration into the Church, already achieved
Baptism. In Baptism
we have been called to form but one body. 2 The Eucharist fulfills
1267 this call: "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participa­
tion in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a
participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we
790 who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread:"234

sacrament that you receive. To that which you are you
respond "Amen" ("yes, it is true!") and by responding to it
you assent to it. For you hear the words, "the Body of Christ"
and respond "Amen." Be then a member of the Body of
Christ that your Amen may be true. 235

1397
The Eucharist commits us to the poor. To receive in truth the
Body and Blood of Christ given up for us, we must recognize Chiist 2449
in the poorest, his brethren:
You have tasted the Blood of the Lord, yet you do not
recognize your brother, . . . . You dishonor this table when
you do not judge worthy of sharing your food someone
judged worthy to take part in this meal. . . . God freed you
from all your sins and invited you here, but you have not
become more merciful. 236

1398
The Eucharist and the unity of Ch ristians. Before the greatness
of this mystery St. Augustine exclaims, "0 sacramen t of devotion! 0
sign of unity! 0 bond of charityf"23 7 The more painful the experience 81 7
of the divisions in the Church which break the common participation in the table of the Lord, the more urgent are our prayers to the
Lord that the time of complete unity among all who believe in him
may return.
1399
The Eastern churches that are not in full communion with the
Catholic Church celebrate the Eucharist with great love. "These Churches,
although separated from us, yet possess true sacraments, above all - by
apostolic succession - the priesthood and the Eucharist, whereby they are
still joined to us in closest intimacy." A certain communion in sacris, and
so in the Eucharist, "given suitable circumstances and the a�proval of
Church authority, is not merely possible but is encouraged."2

838

1400
Ecclesial communities derived from the Reformation and separated from the Catholic Church, "have not preserved the proper reality of
the Eucharistic mystery in its fullness, especially because of the absence of
the sacrament of Holy Orders." 239 It is for this reason that, for the Catholic
Church, Eucharistic intercommunion with these communities is not pos- 1536
sible. However these ecclesial communities, "when they commemorate
the Lord's death and resurrection in the Holy Supper . . . profess that it
signifies life in communion with Christ and await his coming in glory."240
1401
When, in the Ordinary's judgment, a grave necessity arises, 1 483
Catholic ministers may give the sacraments of Eucharist, Penance, and
Anointing of the Sick to other Christians not in full communion with the

THE EUCHARIST - 11PLEDGE OF THE GLORY TO COME"

1402

In an ancient prayer the Church acclaims the mystery of

the Eucharist: "0 sacred banquet in which Christ is received as

food, the memory of his Passion is renewed, the soul is filled with
grace and a pledge of the life to come is given to us ." If the Eucharist

is the memorial of the Passover of the Lord Jesus, if by our communion
at the altar we are filled "with every heavenly blessing and grace,"242

1 130

then the Eucharist is also an anticipation of the heavenly glory.

1403

At the Last Supper the Lord himself directed his disciples'

attention toward the fulfillment of the Passover in the kingdom of
God: "I tell you I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until
that d ay when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. "243
Whenever the Church celebrates the Eucharist she remembers this

promise and turns her gaze "to him who is to come."

671

In her prayer

"Come, Lord Jesus ! " 244
"May your grace come and this world pass away!" 245

she calls for his coming:

1404

"Ma ra na tha ! "

The Church knows that the Lord comes even now in his

Eucharist and that he is there in our midst. However, his presence

1 041
1 028

is veiled . Therefore we celeb rate the Eucharist "awaiting the
blessed hope and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ," 246 asking
"to share in your glory when every tear will be wiped away.

On

that day we shall see you, our God, as you are. We shall become
like you and praise you for ever through Chris t our Lord . "247

1 042 1405

There is no surer pledge or clearer sign of this great hope

in the new heavens and new earth "in which righteousness
dwells," 248 than the Eucharist. Every time this mystery is cele­
brated, "the work of our redemption is carried on" and we "break
the one bread that provides the medicine of immortality, the anti-

1 000

dote for death, and the food that makes us live for ever in Jesus

Chris t. " 249

IN BRIEF
1406

Jesus s aid : "I am the living b read that came down
from heaven; if any one e a ts of this bread, he will
live for ever; . . . he who eats my flesh and d rinks my
blood has eternal life and . . . abides in me, and I in
him"

1407

(Jn 6:51, 54, 56).

The Eucharist is the heart and the summit of the
Church's life, for in it Christ associates his Church and
all her members with his sacrifice of praise and thanks­
giving offered once for all on the cross to his Father;
by this sacrifice he pours out the graces of salvation 'Jn
his Body which is the Church.

1408

The Eucharistic celebration always includes: the proc­
lamation of the Word of God; thanksgiving to God the
Father for all his benefits, above all the gift of his Son;
the consecration of bread and wine; and participation
in the liturgical banquet by receiving the Lord's body
and blood . These elements constitute one single act of
worship .

1409

The Eucharist is the memorial of Christ's Passover,
that is, of the work of salvation accomplished by the
life, death, and resurrection of Christ, a work made
present by the liturgical action.

1410

It is Christ himself, the eternal high priest of the New
Covenant who, acting through the ministry of the
priests, offers the Eucharistic sacrifice. And it is the
same Christ, really present under the species of bread
and wine, who is the offering of the Eucharistic sacrifice.

1411

Only validly ordained priests can preside at the Eucha­
rist and consecrate the bread and the wine so that they
become the Body and Blood of the Lord .

1412

The essential signs of the Eucharistic sacrament are
wheat bread and grape wine, on which the blessing of
the Holy Spirit is invoked and the priest pronounces
the words of consecration spoken by Jesus during the
Last Supper: "This is my body which will be given up
for you . . . . This is the cup of my blood . . . .

249 LG 3; St. Ignatius of Antioch, Ad Eph. 20, 2: SCh 10, 76.

"

Part Two

356
1413

By the consecration the transubstantiation of the bread

and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ is brought

about. Under the consecrated species of bread and
wine Chris t himself, living and glorious, is present in
a true, real, and substantial manner: his Body and his

Blood, with his soul and his d ivinity (cf. Council of
Trent: DS

1414

1640; 1651).

As sacrifice, the Eucharist is also offered in reparation
for the sins of the living and the dead and to obtain
spiritual or temporal benefits from God.

1415

Anyone who desires to receive Christ in Eucharistic
communion must be in the s tate of grace. Anyone

aware of having sinned mortally must not receive

communion without having received absolution in the
sacrament of penance .

1416

Communion with the Body and Blood of Christ in­
creases the communicant's union with the Lord, for­
gives his venial sins, and preserves him from grave

sins . Since receiving this sacrament strengthens the

b onds of charity b e tween the communicant and
Christ, it also reinforces the unity of the Church as the
Mystical Body of Christ.

1417

The Church warmly recommends that the faithful
receive Holy Communion when they participate in the
celebration of the Eucharist; she obliges them to do so

at least once a year.

1418

Because Chris t himself is present in the sacrament of
the altar, he is to be honored with the worship of

adoration. "To visit the Blessed Sacrament is . . . a proof
of gratitude, an expression of love,

and a duty of

adoration toward Christ our Lord " (Paul

1419

VI, MF 66) .

Having passed from this world to the Father, Christ

gives us in the Eucharist the pledge of glory with him.
Participation in the Holy Sacrifice identifies us with his

Heart, sustains our s trength along the pilgrimage of
this life, makes us long for eternal life, and unites us

even now to the Church in heaven, the Blessed Virgin
Mary, and all the saints .

THE SACRAMENTS OF HEALING
1420
Through the sacraments of Christian initiation, man re­
ceives the new life of Christ. Now we carry this life "in earthen
vessels," and it remains "hidden with Christ in God." 1 We are still
in our "earthly tent," subject to suffering, illness, and death.2 This
new life as a child of God can be weakened and even lost by sin.
1421
The Lord Jesus Christ, physician of our souls and bodies,
who forgave the sins of the paralytic and restored him to bodily
health,3 has willed that his Church continue, in the power of the
Holy Spirit, his work of healing and salvation, even among her own
members. This is the purpose of the two sacraments of healing: the
sacrament of Penance and the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick

THE SACRAMENT OF PENANCE
AND RECONCILIATION

1422
"Those who approach the sacrament of Penance obtain 980
pardon from God's mercy for the offense committed against him,
and are, at the same time, reconciled with the Church which they
have wounded by their sins and which by charity, by example, and
by prayer labors for their conversion." 4

WHAT Is THIS SACRAMENT CALLED?

1423
It is called the sacrament of conversion because it makes 1 989
sacramentally present Jesus' call to conversion, the first step in
returning to the FatherS from whom one has strayed by sin.

It is called the sacrament of Penance, since it consecrates the 1 440
Christian sinner's personal and ecclesial steps of conversion, penance, and satisfaction.
1424
It is called the sacrament of confession, since the disclosure 1 456
or confession of sins to a priest is an essential element of this
sacrament. In a profound sense it is also a "confession" - acknow1

ledgment and praise - of the holiness of God and of his mercy
toward sinful man.
1 449

It is called the sacrament offorgiveness, since by the priest's
sacramental absolution God grants the penitent "pardon and
peace." 6

1 442

It is called the sacrament of Reconciliation, because it imparts
to the sinner the love of God who reconciles: "Be reconciled to
God." 7 He who lives by God's merciful love is ready to respond to
the Lord's call: "Go; first be reconciled to your brother." 8

WHY A SACRAMENT OF RECONCILIATION
AFTER B APTISM?

1 263 1425
"You were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified
in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God." 9
One must appreciate the magnitude of the gift God has given us in
the sacraments of Christian initiation in order to grasp the degree
to which sin is excluded for him who has "put on Christ." 10 But the
apostle John also says: "If we say we have no sin, we deceive
ourselves, and the truth is not in us." 11 And the Lord himself taught
2838 us to pray: "Forgive us our trespasses," 12 linking our forgiveness
of one another's offenses to the forgiveness of our sins that God
will grant us.
1426
Conversion to Christ, the new birth of Baptism, the gift of
the Holy Spirit and the Body and Blood of Christ received as food
have made us "holy and without blemish," just as the Church
herself, the Bride of Christ, is "holy and without blemish." 1 3 Nev­
ertheless the new life received in Christian initiation has not abol­
ished the frailty and weakness of human nature, nor the inclination
405, 978 to sin that tradition calls concupiscence, which remains in the bap1 2 64 tized such that with the help of the grace of Christ they may prove
themselves in the struggle of Christian life. 1 4 This is the struggle of
conversion directed toward holiness and eternal life to which the
Lord never ceases to call us. 15

THE CONVERSION OF THE BAPTIZED

III.

Jesus calls to conversion. This call is an essential part of the 541
proclamation of the kingdom: "The time is fulfilled, and the king­
dom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel." 16 In the
Church's preaching this call is addressed first to those who do not
yet know Christ and his Gospel. Also, Baptism is the principal place
for the first and fundamental conversion. It is by faith in the Gospel
and by Baptism 1 7 tha t one renounces evil and gains salvation, that 1226
is, the forgiveness of all sins and the gift of new life.

1427

1428
Christ's call to conversion continues to resound in the lives
of Christians. This second conversion is an uninterrupted task for the
whole Church who, "clasping sinners to her bosom, [is] at once holy 1 036
and always in need of purification, [and] follows constantly the path
of penance and renewal." 18 This endeavor of conversion is not just a 853
human work. It is the movement of a "contrite heart," drawn and
moved by grace to respond to the merciful love of God who loved us 1 996
first. 19
1429
St. Peter's conversion after he had denied his master three
times bears witness to this. Jesus ' look of infinite mercy drew tears
of repentance from Peter and, after the Lord's resurrection, a
threefold affirmation of love for him. 20 The second conversion also
has a communitarian dimension, as is clear in the Lord's call to a
whole Church: " Repent ! "2 1
St. Ambrose says of the two conversions that, in the Church,
"there are water and tears: the w a ter of Baptism and the tears
of repentance. "22

IV.

INTERIOR PENANCE

1430
Jesus' call to conversion and penance, like that of the
prophets before him, does not aim first at outward works, "sackcloth and ashes," fasting and mortification, but at the conversion of
the heart, interior conversion. Without this, such penances remain
sterile and false; however, interior conversion urges expression in 1098
visible signs, gestures and works of penance.23

Part Two

1431
Interior repentance is a radical reorientation of our whole
life, a return, a conversion to God with all our heart, an end of sin,
1 451 a turning away from evil, with repugnance toward the evil actions
we have committed. At the same time it entails the desire and
resolution to change one's life, with hope in God's mercy and trust
in the help of his grace. This conversion of heart is accompanied by
a salutary pain and sadness which the Fathers called animi cruciatus
368 (affliction of spirit) and compunctio cordis (repentance of heart). 24
The human heart is heavy and hardened. God must give
man a new heart. 25 Conversion is first of all a work of the grace of
1 989 God who makes our hearts return to him: "Restore us to thyself, 0
L ORD, that we may be restored!" 26 God gives us the strength to
begin anew. It is in discovering the greatness of God's love that our
heart is shaken by the horror and weight of sin and begins to fear
offending God by sin and being separated from him. The human
heart is converted by looking upon him whom our sins have
pierced: 27

1432

Let us fix our eyes on Christ's blood and understand how
precious it is to his Father, for, poured out for our salvation.<
it has brought to the whole world the grace of repentance. 20

Since Easter, the Holy Spirit has proved "the world wrong
729 1433
about sin," 29 i.e., proved that the world has not believed in him
whom the Father has sent. But this same Spirit who brings sin to
692, 1 848 light is also the Consoler who gives the human heart grace for
repentance and conversion. 30
V.

THE MANY FORMS OF PENANCE IN CHRISTIAN LIFE

1 969 1434

The interior penance of the Christian can be expressed in many
and various ways. Scripture and the Fathers insist above all on three forms,
fasting, prayer, and almsgiving,31 which express conversion in relation to
oneself, to God, and to others. Alongside the radical purification brought
about by Baptism or martyrdom they cite as means of obtaining forgive­
ness of sins: efforts at reconciliation with one's neighbor, tears of repen­
tance, concern for the salvation of one's neighbor, the intercession of the
saints, and the practice of charity "which covers a multitude of sins.''32

Conversion is accomplished in daily life by gestures of reconcili­
ation, concern for the poor, the exercise and defense of justice and right,33
by the admission of faults to one's brethren, fraternal correction, revision
of life, examination of conscience, spiritual direction, acceptance of suffer­
ing, endurance of persecution for the sake of righteousness. Taking up
one's cross each day and following Jesus is the surest way of penance. 34

Eucharist and Penance. Daily conversion and penance find their
source and nourishment in the Eucharist, for in it is made present the
sacrifice of Christ which has reconciled us with God. Through the Eucha­
rist those who live from the life of Christ are fed and strengthened. "It is a
remedy to free us from our daily faults and to preserve us from mortal
5
sins."3

1 394

Reading Sacred Scripture, praying the Liturgy of the Hours and
1437
the Our Father - every sincere act of worship or devotion revives the spirit
of conversion and repentance within us and contributes to the forgiveness
of our sins.

1438
The seasons and dnys of penance in the course of the liturgical year
(Lent, and each Friday in memory of the death of the Lord) are intense
moments of the Church's penitential practice. 36 These times are particularly appropriate for spiritual exercises, penitential liturgies, pilgrimages
as signs of penance, voluntary self-denial such as fasting and almsgiving,
and fraternal sharing (charitable and missionary works) .
The process of conversion and repentance was described by Jesus in
the parable of the prodigal son, the center of which is the merciful father:3 7
the fascination of illusory freedom, the abandonment of the father's house;
the extreme misery in which the son finds himself after squandering his
fortune; his deep humiliation at finding himself obliged to feed swine, and
still worse, at wanting to feed on the husks the pigs ate; his reflection on
all he has lost; his repentance and decision to declare himself guilty before
his father; the journey back; the father's generous welcome; the father's joy
- all these are characteristic of the process of conversion. The beautiful
robe, the ring, and the festive banquet are symbols of that new life - pure,
worthy, and joyful - of anyone who returns to God and to the bosom of
his family, which is the Church. Only the heart of Christ who knows the
depths of his Father's love could reveal to us the abyss of his mercy in so
simple and beautiful a way.

forgiveness and reconciliation with the Church, which are ex­
pressed and accomplished liturgically by the sacrament of Penance
and Reconciliation.38
Only God forgives sin

Only God forgives sins.39 Since he is the Son of God, Jesus
says of himself, "The Son of man has authority on earth to forgive
589 sins" and exercises this divine power: "Your sins are forgiven." 40
Further, by virtue of his divine authority he gives this power to
men to exercise in his name.4 1

270, 431 1441

1442
Christ has willed that in her prayer and life and action his
whole Church should be the sign and instrument of the forgiveness
and reconciliation that he acquired for us at the price of his blood.
But he entrusted the exercise of the power of absolution to the
983 apostolic ministry which he charged with the "ministry of recon­
ciliation."42 The apostle is sent out "on behalf of Christ" with "God
making his appeal" through him and pleading: "Be reconciled to
God."43
Reconciliation with the Church
1443
During his public life Jesus not only forgave sins, but also
made plain the effect of this forgiveness: he reintegrated forgiven
sinners into the conununity of the People of God from which sin
545 had alienated or even excluded them. A remarkable sign of this is
the fact that Jesus receives sinners at his table, a gesture that
expresses in an astonishing way both God's forgiveness and the
return to the bosom of the People of God.44

In imparting to his apostles his own power to forgive sins
the Lord also gives them the authority to reconcile sinners with the
Church. This ecclesial dimension of their task is expressed most
notably in Christ's solemn words to Simon Peter: "I will give you
the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth
shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall
be loosed in heaven."45 "The office of binding and loosing which

was given to Peter was also assigned to the college of the apostles
united to its head."46
1445
The words bind and loose mean: whomever you exclude 553
from your communion, will be excluded from communion with
God; whomever you receive anew into your communion, God will
welcome back into his. Reconciliation with the Church is inseparable
from reconciliation with God.
The sacrament of forgiveness
1446
Christ instituted the sacrament of Penance for all sinful 979
members of his Church: above all for those who, since Baptism,
have fallen into grave sin, and have thus lost their baptismal grace 1 856
and wounded ecclesial communion. It is to them that the sacrament
of Penance offers a new possibility to convert and to recover the
grace of justification. The Fathers of the Church present this sacra- 1 990
ment as "the second plank [of salvation] after the shipwreck which
is the loss of grace ."47
1447
Over the centuries the concrete form in which the Church has
exercised this power received from the Lord has varied considerably.
During the first centuries the reconciliation of Christians who had com­
mitted particularly grave sins after their Baptism (for example, idolatry,
murder, or adultery) was tied to a very rigorous discipline, according to
which penitents had to do public penance for their sins, often for years,
before receiving reconciliation. To this "order of penitents" (which con­
cerned only certain grave sins), one was only rarely admitted and in certain
regions only once in a lifetime. During the seventh century Irish mission­
aries, inspired by the Eastern monastic tradition, took to continental
Europe the "private" practice of penance, which does not require public
and prolonged completion of penitential works before reconciliation with
the Church. From that time on, the sacrament has been performed in secret
between penitent and priest. This new practice envisioned the possibility
of repetition and so opened the way to a regular frequenting of this
sacrament. It allowed the forgiveness of grave sins and venial sins to be
integrated into one sacramental celebration. In its main lines this is the
form of penance that the Church has practiced down to our day.
1448
Beneath the changes in discipline and celebration that this
sacrament has undergone over the centuries, the samefundamen tal
structure is to be discerned . It comprises two equally essential
elements: on the one hand, the acts of the man who undergoes
conversion through the action of the Holy Spirit: namely, contri­
tion, confession, and satisfaction; on the other, God's action
through the intervention of the Church. The Church, who through

Part Two

the bishop and his priests forgives sins in the name of Jesus Christ
and determines the manner of satisfaction, also prays for the sinner
and does penance with him. Thus the sinner is healed and re-es­
tablished in ecclesial communion.
1 481 1449
The formula of absolution used in the Latin Church expresses the essential elements of this sacrament: the Father of
mercies is the source of all forgiveness. He effects the reconciliation
234 of sinners through the Passover of his Son and the gift of his Spirit,
through the prayer and ministry of the Church:
God, the Father of mercies,
through the death and the resurrection of his Son
has reconciled the world to himself
and sent the Holy Spirit among us
for the forgiveness of sins;
through the ministry of the Church
may God give you pardon and peace,
and I absolve you from your sins
in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Spirit. 48

VII.

THE Acrs OF THE PENITENT

1450
"Penance requires . . . the sinner to endure all things
willingly, be contrite of heart, confess with the lips, and practice
complete humility and fruitful satisfaction."49
Contrition
1451
Among the penitent's acts contrition occupies first place.
Contrition is "sorrow of the soul and detestation for the sin com431 mitted, together with the resolution not to sin again."50

1 822 1452
When it arises from a love by which God is loved above all
else, contrition is called "perfect" (contrition of charity). Such
contrition remits venial sins; it also obtains forgiveness of mortal
sins if it includes the firm resolution to have recourse to sacramen­
tal confession as soon as possible.51
1453
The contrition called "imperfect" (or "attrition") is also a
gift of God, a prompting of the Holy Spirit. It is born of the
consideration of sin's ugliness or the fear of eternal damnation and
the other penalties threatening the sinner (contrition of fear) . Such

365

a stirring of conscience can initiate an interior process which, under
the promp ting of grace, will be brought to completion by sacra­
mental absolution. By itself however, imperfect contrition cannot
obtain the forgiveness of grave sins, but it disposes one to obtain
forgiveness in the sacrament of Penance .52

1454

The reception of this sacrament ought to be prepared for by an
made in the light of the Word of God. The
passages best suited to this can be found in the Ten Commandments, the
moral catechesis of the Gospels and the apostolic Letters, such as the
Sermon on the Mount and the apostolic teachings.53

exa m ina tio n of co nscie nce

The confession of sins
1455

The confession (or disclosure) of sins, even from a simply

1 424

human point of view, frees us and facilitates our reconciliation with
others. Through such an admission man looks squarely at the sins
he is guilty of, takes responsibility for them, and thereby opens

1 734

himself again to God and to the communion of the Church in order
to make a new future possible.

1456

Confession to a priest is an essential part of the sacrament

of Penance: "All mortal sins of which penite11ts after a diligent
self-examination are conscious must be recounted by them in

1 855

confession, even if they are most secret and have been committed
against the last two precepts of the Decalogue; for these sins
sometimes wound the soul more grievously and are more dangerous than those which are committed openly."54
When Christ's faithful strive to confess all the sins that they
can remember, they undoubtedly place all of them before
the divine mercy for pardon. But those who fail to do so and
knowingly withhold some, place nothing before the divine
goodness for remission through the mediation of the priest,
"for if the sick person is too ashamed to show his wound to
the doctor, the medicine cannot heal what it does not
know. "55

1457
According to the Church's command, "after having attained the
age of discretion, each of the faithful is bound by an obligation faithfully
to confess serious sins at least once a year."56 Anyone who is aware of
having committed a mortal sin must not receive Holy Communion, even
if he experiences deep contrition, without having first received sacramen52 Cf. Connell of Trent (1551): DS 1678; 1705.

tal absolution, unless he has a grave reason for receiving Communion and
there is no possibil ity of going to confession.5 7 Children must go to the
sacra ment of Penance before receiving Holy Communion for the first
time.58

1458
Without being strictly necessary, confession of everyday
faults (venial sins) is nevertheless strongly recommended by the
Church.5 9 Indeed the regular confession of our venial sins helps us
1 783 form our conscience, fight against evil tendencies, let ourselves be
healed by Christ and progress in the life of the Spirit. By receiving
more frequently through this sacrament the gift of the Father's
mercy, we are spurred to be merciful as he is merciful: 6 0

2468

Whoever confesses his sins . . . is already working with God.
God indicts your sins; if you also indict them, you are joined
with God. Man and sinner are, so to speak, two realities:
when you hear "man" - this is what God has made; when
you hear "sinne r" - this is what man himself has made.
Destroy what you have made, so that God may save what
he has made . . . . When you begin to abhor what you have
made, it is then that your good works are beginning, since
you are accusing yourself of your evil works. The beginning
of good works is the confession of evil works. You do the
truth and come to the light. 6 1

Satisfaction
1459
Many sins wrong our neighbor. One must do what is
possible in order to repair the harm (e.g., return stolen goods,
2412 restore the reputation of someone slandered, pay compensation for
2487 injuries) . Simple justice requires as much. But sin also injures and
weakens the sinner himself, as well as his relationships with God
and neighbor. Absolution takes away sin, but it does not remedy
all the disorders sin has caused. 62 Raised up from sin, the sinner
must still recover his full spiritual health by doing something more
to make amends for the sin: he must "make satisfaction for" or
1473 "expiate" his sins. This satisfaction is also called "penance ."

The Celebration of the Christian Mystery

367

1460
The penance the confessor imposes must take into account
the penitent's personal situation and must seek his spiritual good.
It must correspond as far as possible with the gravity and nature
of the sins committed . It can consist of prayer, an offering, works 2447
of mercy, service of neighbor, voluntary self-denial, sacrifices, and
above all the patient acceptance of the cross we must bear. Such
penances help configure us to Christ, who alone expiated our sins 618
once for all . They allow us to become co-heirs with the risen Christ,
"provided we suffer with him." 63
The satisfaction that we make for our sins, however, is not
so much ours as though it were not done through Jesus
Christ. We who can do nothing ourselves, as if just by
ourselves, can do all things with the cooperation of "him
who strengthens" us. Thus man has nothing of which to
boast, but all our boasting is in Christ . . . in whom we make
satisfaction by bringing forth "fruits that befit repentance."
These fruits have their efficacy from him, by him they are
offered to the Father, and through him they are accepted by
64
the Father.

THE MINISTER OF THIS SACRAMENT

1461
Since Christ entrusted to his apostles the ministry of rec- 981
onciliation,65 bishops who are their successors, and priests, the
bishops' collaborators, continue to exercise this ministry. Indeed
bishops and priests, by virtue of the sacrament of Holy Orders,
have the power to forgive all sins "in the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."
1462
Forgiveness of sins brings reconciliation with God, but
also with the Church. Since ancient times the bishop, visible head
of a particular Church, has thus rightfully been considered to be 886
the one who principally has the power and ministry of reconciliation: he is the moderator of the penitential discipline. 66 Priests, his 1567
collaborators, exercise it to the extent that they have received the
commission either from their bishop (or religious superior) or the
Pope, according to the law of the ChurchP

Certain particularly grave sins incur excommunication, the most
severe ecclesiastical penalty, which impedes the reception of the sacra­
ments and the exercise of certain ecclesiastical acts, and for which absolu­
tion consequently cannot be granted, according to canon law, except by
the Pope, the bishop of the place or priests authorized by them.68 In danger
of death any priest, even if deprived of faculties for hearing confessions,
can absolve from every sin and excommunication.69
1464
Priests must encourage the faithful to come to the sacra­
ment of Penance and must make themselves available to celebrate
this sacrament each time Christians reasonably ask for it?O

1465
When he celebrates the sacrament of Penance, the priest is
fulfilling the ministry of the Good Shepherd who seeks the lost
983 sheep, of the Good Samaritan who binds up wounds, of the Father
who awaits the prodigal son and welcomes him on his return, and
of the just and impartial judge whose judgment is both just and
merciful. The priest is the sign and the instrument of God's merci­
ful love for the sinner.

1 551 1466
The confessor is not the master of God's forgiveness, but
its servant. The minister of this sacrament should unite himself to
the intention and charity of Christ. 71 He should have a proven
2690 knowledge of Christian behavior, experience of human affairs,
respect and sensitivity toward the one who has fallen; he must love
the truth, be faithful to the Magisterium of the Church, and lead
the penitent with patience toward healing and full maturity. He
must pray and do penance for his penitent, entrusting him to the
Lord's mercy.
1467
Given the delicacy and greatness of this ministry and the
respect due to persons, the Church declares that every priest who
hears confessions is bound under very severe penalties to keep
absolute secrecy regarding the sins that his penitents have con2490 fessed to him. He can make no use of knowledge that confession
gives him about penitents' lives. 72 This secret, which admits of no
exceptions, is called the "sacramental seal," because what the
penitent has made known to the priest remains "sealed" by the
sacrament.

THE EFFECTS OF THIS SACRAMENT

1468
"The whole power of the sacrament of Penance consists in
restoring us to God's grace and joining us with him in an intimate
friendship ." 73 Reconciliation with God is thus the purpose and
effect of this sacrament. For those who receive the sacrament of
Penance with contrite heart and religious disposition, reconciliation "is usually followed by peace and serenity of conscience with
strong spiritual consolation." 74 Indeed the sacrament of Reconcili- 2305
ation with God brings about a true "spiritual resurrection," resto­
ration of the dignity and blessings of the life of the children of God,
of which the most precious is friendship with God?5
1469
This sacrament reconciles us with the Church . Sin damages 953
or even breaks fraternal communion. The sacrament of Penance
repairs or restores it. In this sense it does not simply heal the one
restored to ecclesial communion, but has also a revitalizing effect
on the life of the Church which suffered from the sin of one of her
members ?6 Re-established or strengthened in the corrununion of
saints, the sinner is made stronger by the exchange of spiritual
goods among all the living members of the Body of Christ, whether
still on pilgrimage or already in the heavenly homeland?7
949
It must be recalled that . . . this reconciliation with God leads,
as it were, to other reconciliations, which repair the other
breaches caused by sin. The forgiven penitent is reconciled
with himself in his inmost being, where he regains his innermost truth. He is reconciled with his brethren whom he has
in some way offended and wounded. He is reconciled with
the Church. He is reconciled with all creation ?8

1470
In this sacrament, the sinn e r, placing himself before the
merciful judgment of God, anticipates in a certain way the judgment
to which he will be subjected at the end of his earthly life. For it is 678, 1039
now, in this life, that we are offered the choice between life and
death, and it is only by the road of conversion that we can enter the
Kingdom, from which one is excluded by grave sin?9 In converting
to Christ through penance and faith, the sinn er passes from death
to life and "does not come into judgment." 80

INDULGENCES

1471
The doctrine and practice of indulgences in the Church are
closely linked to the effects of the sacrament of Penance.
What is an indulgence?
"An indulgence is a remission before God of the temporal pun­
ishment due to sins whose guilt has already been forgiven, which the
faithful Christian who is duly disposed gains under certain prescribed
conditions through the action of the Church which, as the minister of
redemption, dispenses and applies with authority the treasury of the
satisfactions of Christ and the saints." 81
"An indulgence is partial or plenary according as it removes
either part or all of the temporal punishment due to sin." 82 The faithful
can gain indulgences for themselves or apply them to the dead.83

The punishments of sin

1 861

1 031

2447

1472
To understand this doctrine and practice of the Church, it is
necessary to understand that sin has a double co nse q uence . Grave sin
deprives us of communion with God and therefore makes us incapable of
eternal life, the privation of which is called the "eternal punishment" of
sin. On the other hand every sin, even venial, entails an unhealthy attach­
ment to creatures, which must be purified either here on earth, or after
death in the state called Purgatory. This purification frees one from what
is called the "temporal punishment" of sin. These two punishments must
not be conceived of as a kind of vengeance inflicted by God from without,
but as following from the very nature of sin. A conversion which proceeds
from a fervent charity can attain the complete purification of the sinner in
such a way that no punishment would remain. 84
1473
The forgiveness of sin and restoration of communion with God
entail the remission of the eternal punishment of sin, but temporal pun­
ishment of sin remains. While patiently bearing sufferings and trials of all
kinds and, when the day comes, serenely facing death, the Christian must
strive to accept this temporal punishment of sin as a grace. He should strive
by works of mercy and charity, as well as by prayer and the various
practices of penance, to put off completely the "old man" and to put on
the "new man."85

In the Communion of Saints
1474

The Christian who seeks to purify himself of his sin and to 946-959
become holy with the help of God's grace is not alone. "The life of each of
God's children is joined in Christ and through Christ in a wonderful way
to the life of all the other Christian brethren in the supernatural unity of
the Mystical Body of Christ, as in a single mystical person." 86
795

1475
In the communion of saints, "a perennial link of charity exists
between the faithful who have already reached their heavenly home, those
who are expiating their sins in purgatory and those who are still pilgrims
on earth. Between them there is, too, an abundant exchange of all good
things." 87 In this wonderful exchange, the holiness of one profits others,
well beyond the harm that the sin of one could cause others. Thus recourse
to the communion of saints lets the contrite sinner be more promptly and
efficaciously purified of the punishments for sin.
14 76

We also call these spiritual goods of the communion of saints the

Ch u rch 's treasury, which is "not the sum total of the material goods which

have accumulated during the course of the centuries. On the contrary the
'treasury of the Church' is the infinite value, which can never be exhausted,
which Christ's merits have before God. They were offered so that the
whole of mankind could be set free from sin and attain communion with 6 1 7
the Father. I n Christ, the Redeemer himself, the satisfactions and merits o f
his Redemption exist and find their efficacy ." 88

1477
"This treasury includes as well the prayers and good works of 969
the Blessed Virgin Mary. They are truly immense, unfathomable, and even
pristine in their value before God. In the treasury, too, are the prayers and
good works of all the saints, all those who have followed in the footsteps
of Christ the Lord and by his grace have made their lives holy and carried
out the mission the Father entrusted to them. In this way they attained
their own salvation and at the same time cooperated in saving their
brothers in the unity of the Mystical Body."89
Obtaining indulgence from God through the Church
1478
An indulgence is obtained through the Church who, by virtue of 981
the power of binding and loosing granted her by Christ Jesus, intervenes
in favor of individual Christians and opens for them the treasury of the
merits of Christ and the saints to obtain from the Father of mercies the
remission of the temporal punishments due for their sins. Thus the Church
does not want simply to come to the aid of these Christians, but also to
spur them to works of devotion, penance, and charity. 90
1479
Since the faithful departed now being purified are also members
of the same communion of saints, one way we can help them is to obtain

indulgences for them, so that the temporal punishments due for their sins

XI.

THE CELEBRATION OF THE SACRAMENT OF PENANCE

1480
Like all the sacraments, Penance is a liturgical action. The
elements of the celebration are ordinarily these: a greeting and
blessing from the priest, reading the word of God to illuminate the
conscience and elicit contrition, and an exhortation to repentance;
the confession, which acknowledges sins and makes them known
to the priest; the imposition and acceptance of a penance; the
priest's absolution; a prayer of thanksgiving and praise and dis­
missal with the blessing of the priest.

1449 1481

The Byzantine Liturgy recognizes several formulas of absolution,
in the form of invocation, which admirably express the mystery of forgive­
ness: "May the same God, who through the Prophet Nathan forgave David
when he confessed his sins, who forgave Peter when he wept bitterly, the
prostitute when she washed his feet with her tears, the publican, and the
prodigal son, through me, a sinner, forgive you both in this life and in the
next and enable you to appear before his awe-inspiring tribunal without
condemnation, he who is blessed for ever and ever. Amen."

1482

The sacrament of Penance can also take place in the framework of a

communal celebration in which we prepare ourselves together for confession

1 1 40

and give thanks together for the forgiveness received. Here, the personal
confession of sins and individual absolution are inserted into a liturgy of the
word of God with readings and a homily, an examination of conscience
conducted in common, a communal request for forgiveness, the Our Father
and a thanksgiving in common. This communal celebration expresses more
clearly the ecclesial character of penance. However, regardless of its manner
of celebration the sacrament of Penance is always, by its very nature, a
liturgical action, and therefore an ecclesial and public action. 91

1 401 1483

In case of grave necessity recourse may be had to a co m m unal
ce le b ra tio n of re co ncilia tio n w ith ge nera l co nfessio n a n d ge nera l a bsolu­
tion. Grave necessity of this sort can arise when there is imminent danger

of death without sufficient time for the priest or priests to hear each
penitent's confession. Grave necessity can also exist when, given the
number of penitents, there are not enough confessors to hear individual
confessions properly in a reasonable time, so that the penitents through
no fault of their own would be deprived of sacramental grace or Holy
Communion for a long time. In this case, for the absolution to be valid the
faithful must have the intention of individually confessing their grave sins
in the time required. 92 The diocesan bishop is the jud�e of whether or not
the conditions required for general absolution exist. A large gathering
of the faithful on the occasion of major feasts or pilgrimages does not
constitute a case of grave necessity. 94

"Individual, integral confession and absolution remain the

only ordinary way for the faithful to reconcile themselves with God
and the Church, unless physical or moral impossibility excuses
from this kind of confession." 95 There are profound reasons for
this. Christ is at work in each of the sacraments. He personally

addresses every sinner: "My son, your sins are forgiven. "96 He is

�

the ph sician tending each one of the sick who need him to cure
them. 9 He raises them up and reintegrates them into fraternal
communion. Personal confession is thus the form most expressive
of reconciliation with God and with the Church.

IN BRIEF
1485

"On the evening of that day, the first day of the week,"
Jesus showed himself to his apostles . "He breathed on
them, and said to them: 'Receive the Holy Spirit. If you
forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain
the sins of any, they are retained"'

1486

(]n 20:19, 22-23).

The forgiveness of sins committed after Baptism is con­
ferred by a particular sacrament called the sacrament of
conversion, confession, penance, or reconciliation.

1487

The sinner wounds God's honor and love, his own
human dignity as a man called to be a son of God, and
the spiritual well-being of the Church, of which each
Christian ought to be a living stone.

1488

To the eyes of faith no evil is graver than sin and
nothing has worse consequences for sinners them­
selves, for the Church, and for the whole worl d .

1489

To return to communion with God after having lost it
through sin is a process born of the grace of God who is

rich in mercy and solicitous for the salvation of men. One
must ask for this precious gift for oneself and for others.

1490

The movement of return to God, called conversion and
repentance, entails sorrow for and abhorrence of sins
committed, and the firm purpose of sinning no more
in the future . Conversion touches the past and the
future and is nourished by hope in God's mercy.

Part Two

1491

The sacrament of Penance is a whole consisting in
three actions of the penitent and the priest's absolu­
tion. The penitent's acts are repentance, confession or
disclosure of sins to the priest, and the intention to
make reparation and do works of reparation.

1492

Repentance (also called contrition) must be inspired by
motives that arise from faith. If repentance arises from
love of charity for God, it is called "perfect" contrition; if
it is founded on other motives, it is called "imperfect."

1493

One who desires to obtain reconciliation with God and
with the Church, must confess to a priest all the un­
confessed grave sins he reme.:nbers after having care­
fully examined his conscience. The confession of
venial faults, without being necessary in itself, is nev­
ertheless strongly recommended by the Church.

1494

The confessor proposes the performance of certain acts
of "satisfaction" or "penance" to be performed by the
penitent in order to repair the harm caused by sin and
to re-establish habits befitting a disciple of Christ.

1495

Only priests who have received the faculty of absolv­
ing from the authority of the Church can forgive sins
in the name of Christ.

1496

The spiritual effects of the sacrament of Penance are:
- reconciliation with God by which the penitent recov­
ers grace;
- reconciliation with the Church;
- remission of the eternal punishment incurred by
mortal sins;
- remission, at least in part, of temporal punishments
resulting from sin;
- peace and serenity of conscience, and spiritual con­
solation;
- an increase of spiritual strength for the Christian battle.

1497

Individual and integral confession of grave sins fol­
lowed by absolution remains the only ordinary means
of reconciliation with God and with the Church.

1498

Through indulgences the faithful can obtain the remis­
sion of temporal punishment resulting from sin for
themselves and also for the souls in Purgatory.

ARTICLE 5
THE ANOINTING OF THE SICK

1499
"By the sacred anointing of the sick and the prayer of the
priests the whole Church commends those who are ill to the
suffering and glorified Lord, that he may raise them up and save
them. And indeed she exhorts them to contribute to the good of the
People of God by freely uniting themselves to the Passion and
death of Christ."98

ITS FOUNDATIONS IN THE ECONOMY OF SALVATION

Illness in human life
1500
Illness and suffering have always been among the gravest
problems confronted in human life. In illness, man experiences his
powerlessness, his limitations, and his finitude. Every illness can
1006
make us glimpse death.
1501
Illness can lead to anguish, self-absorption, sometimes
even despair and revolt against God. It can also make a person
more mature, helping him discern in his life what is not essential
so that he can turn toward that which is . Very often illness provokes
a search for God and a return to him.
The sick person before God
1502
The man of the Old Testament lives his sickness in the
presence of God. It is before God that he laments his illness, and i t
i s of God, Master o f life and death, that he implores healing.99
Illness becomes a way to conversion; God's forgiveness initiates the
healing. 100 It is the experience of Israel that illness is mysteriously
linked to sin and evil, and that faithfulness to God according to his 1 64
law restores life: "For I am the Lord, your healer." 101 The prophet 376
intuits that suffering can also have a redemptive meaning for the
sins of others. 102 Finally Isaiah announces that God will usher in a
time for Zion when he will pardon every offense and heal every
illness. 1 03

Christ the physician

549 1503

Chris t's compassion toward the sick and his many heal-

ings of every kind of infirmity are a resplendent sign that "God has
visited his people" 104 and that the Kingdom of God is close at hand.

Jesus has the power not only to heal, but also to forgive sins; 105 he

1421

has come to heal the whole man, soul and body; he is the physician
the sick have need of. 106 His comp assion toward all who suffer goes
so far that he identifies himself with them: "I was sick and you
visited me." 107 His preferential love for the sick has not ceased

through the centuries to draw the very special attention of Chris-

2288 tians toward all those who suffer in body and soul. It is the source
of tireless efforts to comfort them.

Often Jesus asks the sick to believe. 10 8 He makes use of
signs to heal: spittle and the laying on of hands, l09 mud and
washing. 1 10 The sick try to touch him, "for power came forth from

1504

695
1116

him and healed them all ." 1 ll And so in the sacraments Christ
continues to "touch" us in order to heal us .

1505

Moved by so much suffering Christ not only allows him­

self to be touched by the sick, but he makes their miseries his own:
"He took our infirmities and bore our diseases." 1 12 But he did not
heal all the sick. His healings were signs of the coming of the
Kingdom of God. They ann ounced a more radical healing: the

440 victory over sin and death through his Passover. On the cross

Christ took upon himself the whole weight of evil and took away
the "sin of the world," 1 13 of which illness is only a consequence. By
his p assion and death on the cross Christ has given a new meaning
to suffering: it can henceforth configure us to him and unite us with

307 his redemptive Passion.

"Heal the sick . . . "
1506
Christ invites his disciples to follow him by taking up their
cross in their tu m. 114 By following him they acquire a new outlook
on illness and the sick. Jesus associates them with his own life of
poverty and service. He makes them share in his ministry of
compassion and healing: "So they went out and preached that men 859
should repent. And they cast out many demons, and anointed with
oil many that were sick and healed them." 115
The risen Lord renews this mission ("In my name . . . they
will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover." 116) and
confirms it through the signs that the Church performs by invoking
his name. 117 These signs demonstrate in a special way that Jesus is
430
truly "God who saves."llS

1507

1508
The Holy Spirit gives to some a special charism of heal- 798
ing 119 so as to make manifest the power of the grace of the risen
Lord. But even the most intense prayers do not always obtain the
healing of all illnesses. Thus St. Paul must learn from the Lord that
"my grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in 618
weakness," and that the sufferings to be endured can mean that "in
my flesh I complete what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the
sake of his Body, that is, the Church. "120
"Heal the sick! " 121 The Church has received this charge
from the Lord and strives to carry it out by taking care of the sick
as well as by accompanying them with her prayer of intercession.
She believes in the life-giving presence of Christ, the physician of
souls and bodies. This presence is particularly active through the
sacraments, and in an altogether special way through the Eucharist,
the bread that gives eternal life and that St. Paul suggests is con- 1405
nected with bodily health. 122

However, the apostolic Church has its own rite for the sick,
attested to by St. James: "Is any among you sick? Let him call for
the elders [presbyters] of the Church and let them pray over him,
anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of
faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up; and if
he has committed sins, he will be forgiven." 123 Tradition has rec1 1 1 7 ognized in this rite one of the seven sacraments. 124
A sacrament of the sick
1511
The Church believes and confesses that among the seven
sacraments there is one especially intended to strengthen those
who are being tried by illness, the Anointing of the Sick:
This sacred anointing of the sick was instituted by Christ our
Lord as a true and proper sacrament of the New Testament.
It is alluded to indeed by Mark, but is recommended to the
faithful and promulgated by James the apostle and brother
of the Lord. 1'2 5

1512
From ancient times in the liturgical traditions of both East and
West, we have testimonies to the practice of anointings of the sick with
blessed oil. Over the centuries the Anointing of the Sick was conferred
more and more exclusively on those at the point of death. Because of this
it received the name "Extreme Unction." Notwithstanding this evolution
the liturgy has never failed to beg the Lord that the sick person may recover
his health if it would be conducive to his salvation. l 2 6

The Apostolic Constitution Sacram unctionem infir­

observed:
The sacrament of Anointing of the Sick is given to those who
are seriously ill by anointing them on the forehead and
hands with duly blessed oil - pressed from olives or from
other plants - saying, only once: "Through this holy anoint­
ing may the Lord in his love and mercy help you with the
grace of the Holy Spirit. May the Lord who frees you from
sin save you and raise you up." 129

WHO RECEIVES AND WHO ADMINISTERS
THIS SACRAMENT?

In case of grave illness . . .
1514
The Anointing of the Sick "is not a sacrament for those only
who are at the point of death. Hence, as soon as anyone of the
faithful begins to be in danger of death from sickness or old age,
the fitting time for him to receive this sacrament has certainly
already arrived." 130
If a sick person who received this anointing recovers his
health, he can in the case of another grave illness receive this
sacrament again. If during the same illness the person's condition
becomes more serious, the sacrament may be repeated. It is fitting
to receive the Anointing of the Sick just prior to a serious operation.
The same holds for the elderly whose frailty becomes more pro­
nounced.

1515

" . . . let him call for the presbyters of the Church"
1516
Only priests (bishops and presbyters) are ministers of the
Anointing of the Sick. 131 It is the duty of pastors to instruct the
faithful on the benefits of this sacrament. The faithful should
encourage the sick to call for a priest to receive this sacrament. The
sick should prepare themselves to receive it with good disposi­
tions, assisted by their pastor and the whole ecclesial community,
which is invited to surround the sick in a special way through their
prayers and fraternal attention.
Ill.

How Is THIS SACRAMENT CELEBRATED?

1517
Like all the sacraments the Anointing of the Sick is a 1 1 40
liturgical and communal celebration, 132 whether it takes place in
the family home, a hospital or church, for a single sick person or a
whole group of sick persons. It is very fitting to celebrate it within
the Eucharist, the memorial of the Lord's Passover. If circum­
stances suggest it, the celebration of the sacrament can be preceded
by the sacrament of Penance and followed by the sacrament of the
Eucharist. As the sacrament of Christ's Passover the Eucharist
should always be the last sacrament of the earthly journey, the

Word and sacrament form an indivisible whole. The Lit­
urgy of the Word, preceded by an act of repentance, opens the
celebration. The words of Christ, the witness of the apostles,
awaken the faith of the sick person and of the community to ask
the Lord for the strength of his Spirit.
1519
The celebration of the sacrament includes the following
principal elements: the "priests of the Church" 1 33 - in silence - lay
hands on the sick; they pray over them in the faith of the Church 1 34
- this is the epiclesis proper to this sacrament; they then anoint
them with oil blessed, if possible, by the bishop .
These liturgical actions indicate what grace this sacrament
confers upon the sick.

THE EFFECTS OF THE CELEBRATION
OF THIS SACRAMENT

733

1520
A particular gift of the Holy Spirit. The first grace of this
sacrament is one of strengthening, peace and courage to overcome
the difficulties that go with the condition of serious illness or the
frailty of old age. This grace is a gift of the Holy Spirit, who renews
trust and faith in God and strengthens against the temptations of
the evil one, the temptation to discouragement and anguish in the
face of death. 135 This assistance from the Lord by the power of his
Spirit is meant to lead the sick person to healing of the soul, but
also of the body if such is God's will. 136 Furthermore, "if he has
committed sins, he will be forgiven." 1 37

1 499

1521
Union with the passion of Christ. By the grace of this sacrament
the sick person receives the strength and the gift of uniting himself
more closely to Christ's Passion: in a certain way he is consecrated to
bear fruit by configuration to the Savior's redemptive Passion. Suffer­
ing, a consequence of original sin, acquires a new meaning; it becomes
a participation in the saving work of Jesus.

1523

1020

of the sick is given to all who suffer from serious illness and infirmity,
even more rightly is it given to those at the point of departing this life;
so it

also called sacramentum exeuntium (the sacrament of those
departing).139 The Anointing of the Sick completes our conformity to

is

the death and Resurrection of Christ, just as Baptism began it. It
completes the holy anointings that mark the whole Christian life: that
of Baptism which sealed the new life in us, and that of Confirmation
which strengthened us for the combat of this life.

This last anointing

fortifies the end of our earthly life like a solid rampart for the final
struggles before entering the Father's house.l40

VIATICUM, THE LAST SACRAMENT OF THE CHRISTIAN

1524

In addition to the Anointing of the Sick, the Church offers

1294
1 020

1392

those who are about to leave this life the Eucharist as viaticum.
Communion in the body and blood of Christ, received at this
moment of "passing over" to the Father, has a particular significance and importance. It is the seed of eternal life and the power of
resurrection, according to the words of the Lord: "He who eats my
flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up
at the last day."141 The sacrament of Christ once dead and now
risen, the Eucharist is here the sacrament of passing over from

death to life, from this world to the Father_l42

1525

.

Thus, just as the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and

the Eucharist form a

unity

1 680

called "the sacraments of Christian

initiation," so too it can be said that Penance, the Anointing of the
Sick and the Eucharist as viaticum constitute at the end of Christian
life "the sacraments that prepare for our heavenly homeland" or
the sacraments that complete the earthly pilgrimage.

1527

The sacrament of Anointing of the Sick has as its
purpose the conferral of a special grace on the Chris­
tian experiencing the difficulties inherent in the condi­
tion of grave illness or old age.

1528

The proper time for receiving

this holy

anointing has

certainly arrived when the believer begins to be in
danger of death because of illness or old age.

1529

Each time a Christian falls seriously ill, he may receive
the Anointing of the Sick, and also when, after he has
received it, the illness worsens.

1530

Only priests (presbyters and bishops) can give the
sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick, using oil
blessed by the bishop, or if necessary by the celebrat­
ing presbyter himself.

1531

The celebration of the Anointing of the Sick consists
essentially in the anointing of the forehead and hands
of the sick person (in the Roman Rite) or of other parts
of the body (in the Eastern rite), the anointing being
accompanied by the liturgical prayer of the celebrant
asking for the special grace of

1532

this sacrament.

The special grace of the sacrament of the Anointing of
the Sick has as its effects:
-the uniting of the sick person to the passion of Christ,
for his own good and that of the whole Church;
-the strengthening, peace, and courage to endure in a
Christian manner the sufferings of illness or old age;
-the forgiveness of sins, if the sick person was not able
to obtain it through the sacrament of Penance;
- the restoration of health, if it is conducive to the
salvation of his soul;
-the preparation for passing over to eternal life.

C HAPTER T HREE
THE S ACRAMENTS AT THE S ERVICE OF C OMMUNION

1533

Baptism, Confirmation, and Eucharist are sacraments of

1212

Christian initiation. They ground th e common vocation of all
Christ's disciples, a vocation to holiness and to the mission of
evangelizing the world. They confer the graces needed for the life
according to the Spirit during this life as pilgrims on the march
towards the homeland.

1534

Two other sacraments, Holy Orders and Matrimony, are

directed towards the salvation of others; if they contribute as well to
personal salvation, it is through service to others that they do so. They
confer a particular mission in the Church and serve to build up the
People of God.

1535
Through these sacraments those already consecrated by 784
Baptism and Confirmation1 for the common priesthood of all the
faithful can receive particular consecrations. Those who receive the
sacrament of Holy Orders are consecrated in Christ's name "to feed
the Church by the word and grace of God."2 On their part, "Christian spouses are fortified and, as it were,

consecrated for the duties

and dignity of their state by a special sacrament."3

ARTICLE 6
THE SACRAMENT OF HOLY ORDERS

1536

Holy Orders is the sacrament through which the mission

entrusted by Christ to his apostles continues to be exercised in the
Church until the end of time: thus it

is

the sacrament of apostolic 860

ministry. It includes three degrees: episcopate, presbyterate, and diaconate.

remains powerless to bring about salvation, needing to repeat its
sacrifices ceaselessly and being unable to achieve a definitive sanc­
tification, which only the sacrifice of Christ would accomplish.lO

1541

The liturgy of the Church, however, sees in the priesthood

of Aaron and the service of the Levites, as in the institution of the
seventy elders, 11 a prefiguring of the ordained ministry of the New
Covenant. Thus in the Latin Rite the Church prays in the consecra­
tory preface of the ordination of bishops:

God the Father of our Lord Jesus Chr ist, . . .
by you r gracious word
you have established th ep lan of your Church.
From the beginning,
you chose the descendants of Abraham to be you r holy nati on.
You established rulers and p riests,
and di d not leave you r sanctuary withou t ministers to serv e
you . . . 12
.

1542

At the ordination of priests, the Church prays:

Lord, holy Father, . . .
when you had app ointed high priests to rule your p eop le,
you chose other men next to them in rank and digni ty
to be with them and to help them in their task. . . .
you extended the sp irit of Moses to seventy wise men . .. .
You shar ed among the sons of Aaron
the fullness of their fath er's p ower. 13

1543

In the consecratory prayer for ordination of deacons, the

Church confesses:

Almi ghty God . . . ,
You make the Church, Christ' s body,
grow to its full statur e as a new and greater temp le.
You enrich it with every kind of grace
and perfect it with a diversity of members
to serv e the whole body in a wonderfulp attern ofu nity.

386
The one priesthood of Chris t

1544

Everything that the priesthood of the Old Covenant pre­

figured finds its fulfillment in Christ Jesus, the "one mediator
between God and men."15 The Christian tradition considers Mel-

874 chizedek, "priest of God Most High," as a prefiguration of the
priesthood of Christ, the unique "high priest after the order of

Melchizedek ";16 "holy, blameless, unstained,"17 "by a single offer­
ing he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified,"1 8 that
is, by the unique sacrifice of the cross.

1 367

1545

The redemptive sacrifice of Christ is unique, accomplished

once for all; yet it is made present in the Eucharistic sacrifice of the
Church. The same is true of the one priesthood of Christ; it is made

662

present through the ministerial priesthood without diminishing
the uniqueness of Christ's priesthood: "Only Christ is the true
priest, the others being only his ministers."19

Two participations in the one priesthood of Christ

1546

Christ, high priest and unique mediator, has made of the

Church "a kingdom, priests for his God and Father." 20 The whole

community of believers is, as such, priestly. The faithful exercise
their baptismal priesthood through their participation, each ac-

1 2 68 cording to his own vocation, in Christ's mission as priest, prophet,
and king. Through the sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation
the faithful are "consecrated to be ... a holy priesthood."21

1 1 42

1547

The ministerial or hierarchical priesthood of bishops and

priests, and the common priesthood of all the faithful participate,
"each in its own proper way, in the one priesthood of Christ."

While being "ordered one to another," they differ essentially. 22

In

what sense? While the common priesthood of the faithful is exer­
cised by the unfolding of baptismal grace -a life of faith, hope,
and charity, a life according to the Spirit-, the ministerial priest­
hood is at the service of the common priesthood. It is directed at

1 1 20 the unfolding of the baptismal grace of all Christians.The ministe­
rial priesthood is a

sacrament, the sacrament of Holy Orders.

In the person of Christ the Head ...

1548

In the ecclesial service of

the ordained minister, it is Christ 875

himself who is present to his Church as Head of his Body, Shepherd 792
of his flock, high priest of the redemptive sacrifice, Teacher of Truth.
This is what the Church means by saying that the priest, by virtue of
the sacrament of Holy Orders, acts

in persona Christi Capitis:23

It is the same pr iest, C hr ist Jesus, whose sacr ed p er son his
minister tru lyr epr esents. N ow the minister , byr eason of the
sacer dotal consecr ation which he hasr eceived, is tru ly made

the p ower and p lace of thep er son of Chr ist himself (virtute

C hr ist is the sour ce of allpr iesthood: thepr iest of the old law
was a figur e of Chr is � and the pr iest of the new law acts in
thep er son of Chr ist. 2

1549

Through the ordained ministry, especially that of bishops

and priests, the presence of Christ as head of the Church is made

visible in the midst of the community of believers. 26 In the beautiful
expression of St. Ignatius of Antioch, the bishop is typos

he is like the living image of God the Father.27

tou Patros:

1 142

This presence of Christ in the minister is not to be understood
if the latter were preserved from all human weaknesses, the spirit

1550
as

of domination, error, even sin. The power of the Holy Spirit does not 896
guarantee all acts of ministers in the same way. While this guarantee
extends to the sacraments, so that even the minister's sin canno t
impede the fruit of grace, in many other acts the minister leaves 1128
human traces that are not always signs of fidelity to the Gospel and

1584

consequently can harm the apostolic fruitfulness of the Church.

1551

This priesthood is ministerial. "That office ... which the

Lord committed to the pastors of his people, is in the strict sense of

the term a service."28It is entirely related to Christ and to men. It 876

depends entirely on Christ and on his unique priesthood; it has
been instituted for the good of men and the communion of the
Church. The sacrament of Holy Orders communicates a "sacred

1 538
608

power" which is none other than that of Christ. The exercise of

this

authority must therefore be measured against the model of Christ,
who by love made himself the least and the servant of all.29 "The Lord
said clearly that concern for his flock was proof of love for him. "30

. . . "in the name of the whole Church"

1 552

The ministerial priesthood has the task not only of repre­

senting Christ - Head of the Church - before the assembly of the
faithful, but also of acting in the name of the whole Church when
presenting to God the prayer of the Church, and above all when
offering the Eucharistic sacrifice.31

1553

"In

the name of the

whole

Church" does not mean that

priests are the delegates of the community. The prayer and offering
of the Church are inseparable from the prayer and offering of
Christ, her head; it is always the case that Christ worships in and
through his Church. The whole Church, the Body of Christ, prays
and offers herself "through him, with him, in him, " in the unity of

795

the Holy Spirit, to God the Father. The whole Body, caput et membra,
prays and offers itself, and therefore those who in the Body are
especially his ministers are called ministers not only of Christ, but
also of the Church. It is because the ministerial priesthood repre­
sents Christ that it can represent the Church.

1 536

III.

THE THREE DEGREES OF THE SACRAMENT OF HOLY ORDERS

1554

"The divinely instituted ecclesiastical ministry is exercised

in different degrees by those who even from ancient times have
been called bishops, priests, and deacons."32 Catholic doctrine,
expressed in the liturgy, the Magisterium, and the constant practice
of the Church, recognizes that there are two degrees of ministerial
participation in the priesthood of Christ: the episcopacy and the

presbyterate. The diaconate is intended to help and serve them. For this

reason the term sacerdos in current usage denotes bishops and priests
but not deacons. Yet Catholic doctrine teaches that the degrees of
priestly participation (episcopate and presbyterate) and the degree of

389

service (diaconate) are all three conferred by a sacramental act
called "ordination," that is, by the sacrament of Holy Orders:
1538
Let everyone revere the deacons as Jesus Christ, the bishop
as the image of the Father, and the presbyters as the senate
of God and the assembly of the a ostles. For without them
one cannot speak of the Church.3

,r

Episcopal ordination- fullness of the sacrament
of Holy Orders

1555
"Amongst those various offices which have been exercised
in the Church from the earliest times the chief place, according to
the witness of tradition, is held by the function of those who,
through their appointment to the dignity and responsibility of
bishop, and in virtue consequently of the unbroken succession
going back to the beginning, are regarded as transmitters of the 861
apostolic line."3 4
1 556
To fulfil their exalted mission, "the apostles were endowed
by Christ with a special outpouring of the Holy Spirit coming upon
them, and by the imposition of hands they passed on to their 862
auxiliaries the gift of the Spirit, which is transmitted down to our
day through episcopal consecration."35
1557
The Second Vatican Council "teaches . . . that the fullness of
the sacrament of Holy Orders is conferred by episcopal consecration,
that fullness namely which, both in the liturgical tradition of the
Church and the language of the Fathers of the Church, is called the
high priesthood, the acme (summa) of the sacred ministry."36

1558
"Episcopal consecration confers, together with the office 895
of sanctifying, also the offices of teaching and ruling. ... In fact . . . by
the imposition of hands and through the words of the consecration, 1 1 21
the grace of the Holy Spirit is given, and a sacred character is
impressed in such wise that bishops, in an eminent and visible
manner, take the place of Christ himself, teacher, shepherd, and
priest, and act as his representative (in Eius persona agant). "37 "By
virtue, therefore, of the Holy Spirit who has been given to them,
bishops have been constituted true and authentic teachers of the
faith and have been made pontiffs and pastors."38

1559

"One is constituted a member of the episcopal body in

virtue of the sacramental consecration and by the hierarchical
communion with the head and members of the college."39 The
character and

877

collegial nature of the

episcopal order are evidenced

among other ways by the Church's ancient practice which calls for
several bishops to participate in the consecration of a new bishop.40
In our day, the lawful ordination of a bishop requires a special
intervention of the Bishop of Rome, because he is the supreme

882

visible bond of the communion of the particular Churches in the
one Church and the guarantor of their freedom.

833 1560

As Christ's vicar, each bishop has the pastoral care of the

particular Church entrusted to him, but at the same time he bears
collegially with all his brothers in the episcopacy the

886 all the Churches:

solicitude for

"Though each bishop is the lawful pastor only of

the portion of the flock entrusted to his care, as a legitimate succes­
sor of the apostles he is, by divine institution and precept, respon­
sible with the other bishops for the apostolic mission of the
Church."41

1369 1561

The above considerations explain why the Eucharist cele-

brated by the bishop has a quite special significance as an expres­
sion of the Church gathered around the altar, with the one who
represents Christ, the Good Shepherd and Head of his Church,
presiding.42

The ordination of priests - co-workers of the bishops

1562

"Christ, whom the Father hallowed and sent into the

world, has, through his apostles, made their successors, the bish­
ops namely, sharers in his consecration and mission; and these, in
their tum, duly entrusted in varying degrees various members of
the Church with the office of their rninistry."43 "The function of the
bishops' ministry was handed over in a subordinate degree to
priests so that they might be appointed in the order of the priest­

co-workers of the episcopal order for the proper fulfillment
of the apostolic mission that had been entrusted to it by Christ."44

"Because it is joined with the episcopal order the office of
priests shares in the authority by which Christ himself builds up
and sanctifies and rules his Body. Hence the priesthood of priests,
while presupposing the sacraments of initiation, is nevertheless
conferred by its own particular sacrament. Through that sacrament
priests by the anointing of the Holy Spirit are signed with a special
character and so are configured to Christ the priest in such a way 1 1 21
that they are able to act in the person of Christ the head."45

1563

"Whilst not having the supreme degree of the pontifical
office, and notwithstanding the fact that they depend on the bish­
ops in the exercise of their own proper power, the priests are for
all that associated with them by reason of their sacerdotal dignity;
and in virtue of the sacrament of Holy Orders, after the image of
Christ, the supreme and eternal priest, they are consecrated in
order to preach the Gospel and shepherd the faithful as well as to
celebrate divine worship as true priests of the New Testament."46
61 1

1564

1565
Through the sacrament of Holy Orders priests share in the
universal dimensions of the mission that Christ entrusted to the
apostles. The spiritual gift they have received in ordination pre- 849
pares them, not for a limited and restricted mission, "but for the
fullest, in fact the universal mission of salvation 'to the end of the
earth,"' 47 "prepared in spirit to preach the Gospel everywhere. "48

his mystery, they unite the votive offerings of the faithful to the
sacrifice of Christ their head, and in the sacrifice of the Mass they
make present again and apply, until the coming of the Lord, the
unique sacrifice of the New Testament, that namely of Christ
offering himself once for all a spotless victim to the Father." 49 From 61 1
this unique sacrifice their whole priestly ministry draws its

"The priests, prudent cooperators of the episcop al college

and its support and instrument, called to the service of the People
of God, constitute, together with their bishop, a unique sacerdotal
college

(presbyterium)

dedicated, it is true, to a variety of distinct

duties. In each local assembly of the faithful they represent, in a

2 1 79

certain sense, the bishop, with whom they are associated in all trust
and generosity; in part they take upon themselves his duties and
solicitude and in their daily toils discharge them . " 51 Priests can

exercise their ministry only in dependence on the bishop and in
communion with him. The promise of obedience they make to the
bishop at the moment of ordination and the kiss of peace from him
at the end of the ordination liturgy mean that the bishop considers
them his co-workers, his sons, his brothers and his friends, and that
they in return owe him love and obedience.

"All priests, who are constituted in the order of priesthood

by the sacrament of Order, are bound together by an intimate
sacramental brotherhood, but in a special way they form one
priestly body in the diocese to which they are attached under their

own bishop . . . . " 52 The unity of the presbyterium finds liturgical

expression in the custom of the presbyters' imposing hands, after
the bishop, during the rite of ordination.

At a lower level of the hierarchy are to be found deacons,

who receive the imposition of hands 'not unto the priesthood, but
unto the ministry."'53 At an ordination to the diaconate only the
b ishop lays hands on the candidate, thus signifying the deacon's
special attachment to the bishop in the tasks of his diakonia ." 54

Deacons share in Christ's mission and grace in a special
way. 5 5The sacrament of Holy Orders marks them with an imprint
("character" ) which cannot be removed and which configures them

to Christ, who made himself the "deacon" or servant of all. 56
Among other tasks, it is the task of deacons to assist the bishop and
priests in the celebration of the divine mysteries, above all the
Eucharist, in the distribution of Holy Communion, in assisting at
and blessing marriages, in the proclamation of the Gospel and

1571

Since the Second Vatican Council the Latin Church has restored
5
the diaconc.te "as a proper and permanent rank of the hierarchy," 8 while
the Churches of the East had always maintained it. This permanent diaconate, which can be conferred on married men, constitutes an important
enrichment for the Church's mission. Indeed it is appropriate and useful
that men who carry out a truly diaconal ministry in the Church, whether
in its liturgical and pastoral life or whether in its social and charitable
works, should "be strengthened by the imposition of hands which has
come down from the apostles. They would be more closely bound to the
altar and their ministry would be made more fruitful through the sacra­
59
mental grace of the diaconate."

IV.

THE CELEBRATION OF THIS SACRAMENT

1572

Given the importance that the ordination of a bishop, a

1579

priest, or a deacon has for the life of the particular Church, its
celebration calls for as many of the faithful as possible to take part.
It should take place preferably on Sunday, in the cathedral, with
solemnity appropriate to the occasion. All three ordinations, of the
bishop, of the priest, and of the deacon, follow the same movement.
Their proper place is within the Eucharistic liturgy.

1573

The essential rite of the sacrament of Holy Orders for all three

degrees consists in the bishop's imposition of hands on the head of
the ordinand and in the bishop's specific consecratory prayer asking
God for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and his gifts proper to the
ministry to which the candidate is being ordained.60

1574
As in all the sacraments additional rites surround the celebration.
Varying greatly among the different liturgical traditions, these rites have
in common the expression of the multiple aspects of sacramental grace.
Thus in the Latin Church, the initial rites- presentation and election of the
ordinand, instruction by the bishop, examination of the candidate, litany
of the saints - attest that the choice of the candidate is made in keeping
with the practice of the Church and prepare for the solemn act of conse­
cration, after which several rites symbolically express and complete the
mystery accomplished: for bishop and priest, an anointing with holy
chrism, a sign of the special anointing of the Holy Spirit who makes their
ministry fruitful; giving the book of the Gospels, the ring, the miter, and
the crosier to the bishop as the sign of his apostolic mission to proclaim the
Word of God, of his fidelity to the Church, the bride of Christ, and his office
as shepherd of the Lord's flock; presentation to the priest of the paten and
chalice, "the offering of the holy people" which he is called to present to

V.

WHO CAN CONFER THIS SACRAMENT?

1575
Christ himself chose the apostles and gave them a share in his
mission and authority. Raised to the Father's right hand, he has not
forsaken his flock but he keeps it under his constant protection through
857 the apostles, and guides it still through these same pastors who continue
his wo1k today.61 Thus, it is Christ whose gift it is that some be apostles,
others pastors. He continues to act through the bishops.62
Since the sacrament of Holy Orders is the sacrament of the
apostolic ministry, it is for the bishops as the successors of the
apostles to hand on the "gift of the Spirit,"63 the "apostolic line." 64
Validly ordained bishops, i.e., those who are in the line of apostolic
succession, validly confer the three degrees of the sacrament of
Holy Orders.65

1536 1576

WHO CAN RECEIVE THIS SACRAMENT?

VI.

"Only a baptized man (vir) validly receives sacred ordina­
tion." 66 The Lord Jesus chose men (viri) to form the college of the
551 twelve apostles, and the apostles did the same when they chose
861 collaborators to succeed them in their ministry.67 The college of
bishops, with whom the priests are united in the priesthood, makes
862 the college of the twelve an ever-present and ever-active reality
until Christ's return. The Church recognizes herself to be bound by
this choice made by the Lord himself. For this reason the ordination
of women is not possible.68

1577

1578
No one has a right to receive the sacrament of Holy Orders.
Indeed no one claims this office for himself; he is called to it by
2121 God. 69 Anyone who thinks he recognizes the signs of God's call to
the ordained ministry must humbly submit his desire to the
authority of the Church, who has the responsibility and right to call

someone to receive orders . Like every grace this sacrament can be

received only as an unmerited gift.
1579

All the ordained ministers of the Latin Church, with the

exception of permanent deacons, are normally chosen from among
men of faith who live a celibate life and who intend to remain

celibate "for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. " 70 Called

to conse-

1618

crate themselves with undivided heart to the Lord and to "the
affairs of the Lord," 71 they give themselves entirely to God and to

men. Celibacy is a sign of this new life to the service of which the

Church's minister is consecrated; accepted with a joyous heart
celibacy radiantly proclaims the Reign of God. 72

1580

In the

2233

Eastern Churches a different discipline has been in

force for many centuries: while bishops are chosen solely from

among celibates, married men can be ordained as deacons and

priests. This practice has long been considered legitimate; these
priests exercise a fruitful ministry within their communities?3

Moreover, priestly celibacy is held in great honor in the Eastern

Churches and many priests have freely chosen it for the sake of the
Kingdom of God .

In the East as in the West a man who has already

received the sacrament of Holy Orders can no longer marry.

VII.

THE EFFECTS OF THE SACRAMENT OF HOLY ORDERS

The indelible character
1581

This sacrament configures the recipient to Christ by a

special grace of the Holy Spirit, so that he may serve as Christ's

instrument for his Church. By ordination one is enabled to act as a

1 548

representative of Christ, Head of the Church, in his triple office of

priest, prophet, and king.

1582

As in the case of Baptism and Confirmation this share in

Christ's office i s granted once for all. Th e sacrament o f Holy Orders,

like the other two, confers an indelible spiritual character and cannot
be repeated or conferred temporarily?4

1583

It is true that someone validly ordained can, for grave reasons, be
discharged from the obligations and functions linked to ordination, or can
be forbidden to exercise them; but he cannot become a layman again in the
75
strict sense,
because the character imprinted by ordination is for ever.

T he vocation and mission r eceiv ed on thed ay of his ord ination mar k him
p ermanently.
Since it is ultimately Christ who acts and effects salvation
through the ordained minister, the unworthiness of the latter does not
prevent Christ from acting?6 St. Augustine states this forcefully:

1 128 1584

As for thep rou d minister, he is to be ranked with the dev il.
Christ's gift is not therebyp rofaned: what flows through him
keeps itsp urity, and whatp asses throu gh him remains clear
and reaches the fertile earth . . . . T he spiritu al p ower of the
sacrament is indeed comparable to light: those to be enlight­
ened receive it in its pu rity, and if it should p ass t hrou gh
defiled beings, it is not itself defiled.77

1550

The grace of the Holy Spirit
The grace of the Holy Spirit proper to this sacrament is
configuration to Christ as Priest, Teacher, and Pastor, of whom the
ordained is made a minister.

1585

For the bishop, this is first of all a grace of strength ("the
governing spirit": Prayer of Episcopal Consecration in the Latin
rite)?8 the grace to guide and defend his Church with strength and
2448 prudence as a father and pastor, with gratuitous love for all and a
preferential love for the poor, the sick, and the needy. This grace
impels him to proclaim the Gospel to all, to be the model for his
flock, to go before it on the way of sanctification by identifying
himself in the Eucharist with Christ the priest and victim, not
fearing to give his life for his sheep:

1586

1 558

You have chosen you r servant for the office of bishop .
May he be a shep herd to your holy flock,
and a high priest blameless in your sight,

and offer the gifts of your holy Church.
Through the Spirit who gives the grace of highp riesthood
grant him thep ower
to forgive sins as you have commanded,
to assign ministries as you have decreed,
and to loose from every bond by the authority which you
gave to your ap ostles.

presenting a fragrant offering to you,
through Jesus Christ, your Son . . . _79

1587
The spiritual gift conferred by presbyteral ordination is 1564
expressed by this prayer of the Byzantine Rite. The bishop, while
laying on his hand, says among other things:
Lord, fill with the gift of the Holy Spirit
him whom you have deigned to raise to the rank of the
priesthood,
that he may be worthy to stand without reproach before your
altar,
to proclaim the Gospel of your kingdom,
to fulfill the ministry of your word of truth,
to offer you spiritual gifts and sacrifices,
to renew your people by the bath of rebirth;
so that he may go out to meet
our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, your only Son,
on the day of his second coming,
and may receive from your vast goodness
the recompense for a faithful administration of his order. 80

With regard to deacons, "strengthened by sacramental 1569
grace they are dedicated to the People of God, in conjunction with
the bishop and his body of priests, in the service (diakonia) of the
liturgy, of the Gospel, and of works of charity."81

1588

1589
Before the grandeur of the priestly grace and office, the
holy doctors felt an urgent call to conversion in order to conform
their whole lives to him whose sacrament had made them minis­
ters. Thus St. Gregory of Nazianzus, as a very young priest, ex­
claimed:
We must begin by purifying ourselves before purifying
others; we must be instructed to be able to instruct, become
light to illuminate, draw close to God to bring him close to
others, be sanctified to sanctify, lead by the hand and counsel
prudently. I know whose ministers we are, where we find
ourselves and to where we strive. I know God's greatness
and man's weakness, but also his potentiaL [Who then is the
priest? He is] the defender of truth, who stands with angels,
gives glory with archangels, causes sacrifices to rise to the
altar on high, shares Christ's priesthood, refashions creation,
restores it in God's image, recreates it for the world on high
2
and, even greater, is divinized and divinizes.8

IN BRIEF

1590

St. Paul said to his disciple Timothy: "I remind you to
rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the
laying on of my hands" (2 Tim 1 :6), and "If any one
aspires to the office of bishop, he desires a noble task."
(1 Tim 3:1) To Titus he said: "This is why I left you in
Crete, that you amend what was defective, and ap­
point presbyters in every town, as I directed you"
(Titus 1:5).

1591

The whole Church is a priestly people. Through Bap­
tism all the faithful share in the priesthood of Christ.
This participation is called the "common priesthood
of the faithful." Based on this common priesthood and
ordered to its service, there exists another participa­
tion in the mission of Christ: the ministry conferred by
the sacrament of Holy Orders, where the task is to
serve in the name and in the person of Christ the Head
in the midst of the community.

1592

The ministerial priesthood differs in essence from the
common priesthood of the faithful because it confers
a sacred power for the service of the faithful. The
ordained ministers exercise their service for the People
of God by teaching (munus docendi), divine worship
(munus liturgicum) and pastoral governance (munus

regendi).
1593

Since the beginning, the ordained ministry has been
conferred and exercised in three degrees: that of bish­
ops, that of presbyters, and that of deacons. The mirl­
istries conferred by ordination are irreplaceable for the
organic structure of the Church: without the bishop,
presbyters, and deacons, one cannot speak of the
Church (d. St. Ignatius of Antioch, Ad Trall. 3,1).

1594

The bishop receives the fullness of the sacrament of
Holy Orders, which integrates him into the episcopal
college and makes him the visible head of the particu-

83 St. John Vianney, quoted in B. Nodet, Jean-Marie Vianney, Cured'Ars, 100.

The Celebration of the Christian Mystery
lar Church entrusted to him. As successors of the
apostles and members of the college, the bishops share
in the apostolic responsibility and mission of the
whole Church under the authority of the Pope, succes­
sor of St . Peter.

1595

Priests are united with the bishops in sacerdotal dig­
nity and at the same time depend on them in the
exercise of their pastoral functions; they are called to
be the bishops' prudent co-workers. They form
around their bishop the presbyterium which bears
responsibility with him for the particular Church.
They receive from the bishop the charge of a parish
community or a determinate ecclesial office.

1596

Deacons are ministers ordained for tasks of service of
the Church; they do not receive the ministerial priest­
hood, but ordination confers on them important func­
tions in the ministry of the word, divine worship,
pastoral governance, and the service of charity, tasks
which they must carry out under the pastoral author­
ity of their bishop.

1597

The sacrament of Holy Orders is conferred by the laying
on of hands followed by a solemn prayer of consecration
asking God to grant the ordinand the graces of the Holy
Spirit required for his ministry. Ordination imprints an
indelible sacramental character.

1598

The Church confers the sacrament of Holy Orders only
on baptized men

(viri), whose suitability for the exer­

cise of the ministry has been duly recognized. Church
authority alone has the responsibility and right to call
someone to receive the sacrament of Holy Orders.

1599

In the Latin Church the sacrament of Holy Orders for the
presbyterate

is

normally conferred only on candidates

who are ready to embrace celibacy freely and who pub­
licly manifest their intention of staying celibate for the
love of God's kingdom and the service of men.

It is bishops who confer the sacrament of Holy Orders
in the three degrees.

ARTICLE 7
THE SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY

1601
"The matrimonial covenant, by which a man and a woman
establish between themselves a partnership of the whole of life, is
by its nature ordered toward the good of the spouses and the
procreation and education of offspring; this covenant between
baptized persons has been raised by Christ the Lord to the dignity
of a sacrament." 84
MARRIAGE IN G OD'S PLAN

I.

Sacred Scripture begins with the creation of man and
369 1602
796 woman in the image and likeness of God and concludes with a

vision of "the wedding-feast of the Lamb ." 85 Scripture speaks
throughout of marriage and its "mystery," its institution and the
meaning God has given it, its origin and its end, its various reali­
zations throughout the history of salvation, the difficulties arising
from sin and its renewal "in the Lord" in the New Covenant of
Christ and the Church. 86
Marriage in the order of creation

1603
"The intimate community of life and love which consti­
tutes the married state has been established by the Creator and
371 endowed by him with its own proper laws . . . . God himself is the
author of marriage." 87 The vocation to marriage is written in the
very nature of man and woman as they came from the hand of the
2331 Creator. Marriage is not a purely human institution despite the
many variations it may have undergone through the centuries in
different cultures, social structures, and spiritual attitudes. These
differences should not cause us to forget its common and perma­
nent characteristics. Although the dignity of this institution is not
transparent everywhere with the same clarity,88 some sense of the
greatness of the matrimonial union exists in all cultures. "The
2210 well-being of the individual person and of both human and Chris­
tian society is closely bound up with the healthy state of conjugal
and family life." 89

401

God who created man out of love also calls him to love -

the fundamen tal and innate vocation of every human being. For

man is created in the image and likeness of God who is himself
love. 90 Since God created him man and woman, their mutual love

becomes an image of the absolute and unfailing love with which
God loves man. It is good, very good, in the Creator's eyes . And

355

this love which God blesses is intended to be fruitful and to be

realized in the common work of watching over creation: " And God

blessed them, and God said to them: 'Be fruitful and multiply, and
fill the earth and subdue it."'9 1

1605

Holy Scripture affirms tha t man and woman were created

for one another: "It is not good that the man should be alone. "9 2

3 72

The woman, "flesh of his flesh," his equal, his nearest in all things,
is given to him by God as a "helpmate"; she thus represents God
from whom comes our help . 93 "Therefore a man leaves his father

and his mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one
flesh." 94 The Lord himself shows that this signifies an unbreakable

union of their two lives by recalling what the plan of the Creator

1 614

had been " in the beginning": "So they are n o longer two, b u t one
flesh." 9 5

Marriage under the regime of sin
1606

Every man experiences evil around him and within him­

self. This experience makes itself felt in the relationships between

man and woman. Their union has always been threatened by
discord, a spirit of domination, infidelity, jealousy, and conflicts

that can escalate into hatred and separation. This disorder can

manifest itself more or less acutely, and can be more or less over­
come according to the circumstances of cultures, eras, and indi­

viduals, but it does seem to have a universal character.

1607

According to faith the disorder we notice so painfully does

not stem from the

nature of man and woman, nor from the nature 1849
of their relations, but from sin. As a break with God, the first sin
had for its first consequence the rupture of the original communion 400
between man and woman. Their relations were distorted by mutual recriminations;96 their mutual attrac tion, the Creator's own

gift, changed into a relationship of d mination and lust;97 and the

�

beau tiful vocation of man and woman to be fruitful, multiply, and

subdue the earth was burdened by the pain of childbirth and the
toil of work. 98

55

1608
Nevertheless, the order of creation persists, though seriously disturbed. To heal the wounds of sin, man and woman need
the help of the grace that God in his infinite mercy never refuses

them. 99 Without his help man and woman carmot achieve the

union of their lives for which God created them "in the beginning."

Marriage under the pedagogy of the Law

410

1609

In his mercy God has not forsaken sinful man. The punish­

ments consequent upon sin, "pain in childbearing" and toil "in the
sweat of your brow," 100 also embody remedies that limit the dam­
aging effects of sin . After the fall, marriage helps to overcome

self-absorption, egoism, pursuit of one's own pleasure, and to open
oneself to the other, to mutual aid and to self-giving.

1610

Moral conscience concerning the unity and indissolubility

of marriage developed under the pedagogy of the old law .

1 963
2387

In

the

Old Testament the polygamy of patriarchs and kings is not yet

explicitly rejected . Nevertheless, the law given to Moses aims at

protecting the wife from arbitrary domination by the husband,

man's "hardness of heart" which was the reason Moses permitted
men to divorce their wives .lOl

219

Seeing God's covenant with Israel in the image of exclusive

and faithful married love, the prophets prepared the Chosen Peo-

pie's conscience for a deepened understanding of the unity and
indissolubility of marriage. 102 The books of Ruth and Tobit bear

moving witness to an elevated sense of marriage and to the fidelity
and tenderness of spouses. Tradition has always seen in the

had prepared the way for the new and everlasting covenant in
which the Son of God, by becoming incarnate and giving his life, 521
has united to himself in a certain way all mankind saved by him,
thus preparing for "the wedding-feast of the Lamb. " 104
On the threshold of his public life Jesus performs his first
sign - at his mother's request - during a wedding feast.105 The
Church attaches great importance to Jesus' presence at the wed­
ding at Cana. She sees in it the confirmation of the goodness of
marriage and the proclamation that thenceforth marriage will be
an efficacious sign of Christ's presence.

1613

1614
In his preaching Jesus unequivocally taught the original mean- 2336
ing of the union of man and woman as the Creator willed it from the
beginning: permission given by Moses to divorce one's wife was a
concession to the hardness of hearts.1 06 The matrimonial union of man 2382
and woman is indissoluble: God himself has determined it "what
therefore God has joined together, let no man put asunder."1 07
1615
This unequivocal insistence on the indissolubility of the mar- 2364
riage bond may have left some perplexed and could seem to be a
demand impossible to realize. However, Jesus has not placed on
spouses a burden impossible to bear, or too heavy - heavier than the
Law of Moses.108 By coming to restore the original order of creation
disturbed by sin, he hllnself gives the strength and grace to live marriage
in the new dimension of the Reign of God. It is by following Christ,
renouncing themselves, and taking up their crosses that spouses will be
able to "receive" the original meaning of marriage and live it with the
help of Christ.1 09 This grace of Christian marriage is a fruit of Christ's
1 642
cross, the source of all Christian life.
This is what the Apostle Paul makes clear when he says:
"Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave
himself up for her, that he might sanctify her," adding at once: '"For
this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined
to his wife, and the two shall become one. This is a great mystery,
and I mean in reference to Christ and the Church."110

Part Two
The entire Christian life bears the mark of the spousal love

of Christ and the Church. Already Baptism, the entry into the
People of God, is a nuptial mystery; it is so to speak the nuptial

bath1 1 1 which precedes the wedding feast, the Eucharist. Christian
marriage in its tu m becomes an efficacious sign, the sacrament of
the covenant of Christ and the Church. Since it signifies and com­
municates grace, marriage between baptized persons is a true
sacrament of the New Covenant. 112

Virginity for the sake of the Kingdom

2232 1618

Christ is the center of all Christian life. The bond with him

takes precedence over all other bonds, familial or social. 113 From

the very beginning of the Church there have been men and women
who have renounced the great good of marriage to follow the Lamb

1579

wherever he goes, to be intent on the things of the Lord, to seek to
please him, and to go out to meet the Bridegroom who is coming. 114
Christ himself has invited certain persons to follow him in this way
of life, of which he remains the model:

"For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and
there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men,
and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs
for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to
receive this, let him receive it." 1 15

922-924 1619

Virginity for the sake of the kingdom of heaven is an

unfolding of baptismal grace, a powerful sign of the supremacy of
the bond with Christ and of the ardent expectation of his return, a
sign which also recalls that marriage is a reality of

which is passing away. 116

1620

this present age

Both the sacrament of Matrimony and virginity for the

Kingdom of God come from the Lord himself. It is he who gives
them meaning and grants them the grace which is indispensable

2349

for living them out in conformity with his wil1. 117 Esteem of virginity for the sake of the kingdom11 8 and the Christian understanding
of marriage are inseparable, and they reinforce each other:

Whoever denigrates marriage also diminishes the glory of
virginity. Whoever praises it makes virginity more admira­
ble and resplendent. What appears good only in comparison
with evil would not be truly good. The most excellent good
is something even better than what is admitted to be
9
good. 1 1

II.

THE CELEBRATION OF MARRIAGE

1621
In the Latin Rite the celebration of marriage between two
Catholic faithful normally takes place during Holy Mass, because
of the connection of all the sacraments with the Paschal mystery of
Christ. 1 20 In the Eucharist the memorial of the New Covenant is 1 323
realized, the New Covenant in which Christ has united himself for
ever to the Church, his beloved bride for whom he gave himself
up. 1 2 1 It is therefore fitting that the spouses should seal their
consent to give themselves to each other through the offering of
their own lives by uniting it to the offering of Christ for his Church
made present in the Eucharistic sacrifice, and by receiving the 1368
Eucharist so that, communicating in the same Body and the same
Blood of Christ, they may form but "one body" in Christ. 122
1622
"Inasmuch as it is a sacramental action of sanctification,
the liturgical celebration of marriage . . . must be, per se, valid,
worthy, and fruitful." 1 23 It is therefore appropriate for the bride
and groom to prepare themselves for the celebration of their mar1422
riage by receiving the sacrament of penance.
1623
According to the Latin tradition, the spouses as ministers
of Christ's grace mutually confer upon each other the sacrament of
Matrimony by expressing their consent before the Church. In the
traditions of the Eastern Churches, the priests (bishops or presbyters) are witnesses to the mutual consent given by the spouses, 124
but for the validity of the sacrament their blessing is also neces­
sary. 1 25

Part Two
The various liturgies abound in prayers of blessing and

1624

epiclesis asking God's grace and blessing on the new couple,
especially the bride. In the epiclesis of this sacrament the spouses

73 6

receive the Holy Spirit as the communion of love of Christ and the
Church. 12 6 The Holy Spirit is the seal of their covenant, the ever­
available source of their love and the strength to renew their

fidelity.

III.

MATRIMONIAL CONSENT

1625

The parties to a marriage covenant are a bap tized man and

1 734 woman, free to contract marriage, who freely express their consent;
"to be free" means:

- not being under constraint;
- not impeded by any natural or ecclesiastical law.
The Church holds the exchange of consent between the

1626
2201

spouses to be the indispensable element tha t "makes the mar­
riage. " 127 If consent is lacking there is no marriage .
The consent consists in a "human act by which the partners

1627

mutually give themselves to each other" : "I take you to be my wife"

- "I take you to be my husband . " 128 This consent that binds the
spouses to each other finds its fulfillment in the two "becoming one

flesh . " 129

1 735

The consent must be an act of the will of each of the
contracting parties, free of coercion or grave external fear. 130 No
human power can substitute for this consent. 131 If this freedom is

1628

lacking the marriage is invalid.

1629
For this reason (or for other reasons that render the marriage null
and void) the Church, after an examination of the situation by the compe­
tent ecclesiastical tribunal, can declare the nullity of a marriage, i.e., that
the marriage never existed. 1 32 In this case the contracting parties are free
to marry rovided the natural obligations of a previous union are dis­
i
charged.

407

The priest (or deacon) who assists at the celebration of a

marriage receives the consent of the spouses in the name of the
Church and gives the blessing of the Church. The presence of the
Church's minister (and also of the witnesses) visibly expresses the

fact that marriage is an ecclesial reality.

1631

This is the reason why the Church normally requires that

the faithful contract marriage according to the ecclesiastical form.
Several reasons converge to explain this requirement: 134

- Sacramental marriage is a liturgical act. It is therefore appropriate

1069

- Marriage introduces one into an ecclesial order, and creates rights

1537

that it should be celebrated in the public liturgy of the Church;

and duties in the Church between the spouses and towards their

children;

- Since marriage is a state of life

in the Church, certainty about it is

necessary (hence the obligation to have witnesses);

- The public character of the consent protects the "I do" once given
and helps the spouses remain faithful to it.

1632

2365

So that the "I do" of the spouses may be a free and respon­

sible act and so that the marriage covenant may have solid and
lasting human and Christian foundations, preparation for mar­

riage is of prime importance.

The example and teaching given by parents and families remain
the special form of this preparation.

2206

Th e role of pastors and of the Christian community as the "family
of God" is indispensable for the transmission of the human and Christian
values of marriage and family, 135 and much more so in our era when many
young people experience broken homes which no longer sufficiently
assure this initiation:
It is imperative to give suitable and timely instruction to
young people, above all in the heart of their own families,
about the dignity of married love, its role and its exercise, so
that, having learned the value of chastity, they will be able
at a suitable age to engage in honorable courtship and enter
upon a marriage of their own.1 36

Mixed marriages and disparity of cult
1633
In many countries the situation of a mixed marriage (marriage
between a Catholic and a baptized non-Catholic) often arises. It requires

Part Two

particular attention on the part of couples and their pastors. A case of
marriage with disparity of cult (between a Catholic and a non-baptized
person) requires even greater circumspection.

1634
Difference of confession between the spouses does not constitute
an insurmountable obstacle for marriage, when they succeed in placing in
common what they have received from their respective communities, and
learn from each other the way in which each lives in fidelity to Christ.But
the difficulties of mixed marriages must not be underestimated.They arise
from the fact that the separation of Christians has not yet been overcome.
81 7 The spouses risk experiencing the tragedy of Christian disunity even in
the heart of their own home.Disparity of cult can further aggravate these
difficulties. Differences about faith and the very notion of marriage, but
also different religious mentalities, can become sources of tension in
marriage, especially as regards the education of children.The temptation
to religious indifference can then arise.
1635
According to the law in force in the Latin Church, a mixed
marriage needs for liceity the express permission of ecclesiastical author­
ity.137 In case of disparity of cult an express dispensation from this impedi­
ment is required for the validity of the marriage. 138 This permission or
dispensation presupposes that both parties know and do not exclude the
essential ends and properties of marriage; and furthermore that the Catho­
lic party confirms the obligations, which have been made known to the
non-Catholic party, of preserving his or her own faith and ensuring the
39
baptism and education of the children in the Catholic Church. 1
82 1

1636
Through ecumenical dialogue Christian communities in many
regions have been able to put into effect a common pastoral practicefor mixed
ma rriages. Its task is to help such couples live out their particular situation
in the light of faith, overcome the tensions between the couple's obligations
to each other and towards their ecclesial communities, and encourage the
flowering of what is common to them in faith and respect for what
separates them.
1637
In marriages with disparity of cult the Catholic spouse has a
particular task: "For the unbelieving husband is consecrated through his
wife, and the unbelieving wife is consecrated through her husband." 140 It
is a great joy for the Christian spouse and for the Church if this "consecra­
tion" should lead to the free conversion of the other spouse to the Christian
faith. 141 Sincere married love, the humble and patient practice of the
family virtues, and perseverance in prayer can prepare the non-believing
spouse to accept the grace of conversion.

THE EFFECTS OF THE SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY

1638

"From a valid marriage arises

a bond

between the spouses

which by its very nature is perpetual and exclusive; furthermore, in a
Christian marriage the spouses are strengthened and, as it were,

consecrated for the duties and the dignity of their state

sacrament. " 142

The marriage bond
The consent by which the spouses mutually give and
receive one another is sealed by G od himself. 143 From their cove­

1639

nant arises "an ins titution, confirmed by the divine law, . . . even
in the eyes of society. " 144 The covenant between the spouses is

integrated into God's covenant with man: " Authentic married love

is caught up into divine love." 145

1640

Thus the marriage bond has been established by God himself

in such a way that a marriage concluded and consummated be­

tween baptized persons can never be dissolved. This bond, which

results from the free human act of the spouses and their consum­
mation of the marriage, is a reality, henceforth irrevocable, and

gives rise to a covenant guaranteed by God's fidelity. The Church

does not have the power to contravene this disposition of divine

2365

wisdom. 14 6

The grace of the sacrament of Matrimony
1641

"By reason of their state in life and of their order, [Christian

spouses] have their own special gifts in the People of God . " 147 This

grace proper to the sacrament of Matrimony is intended to perfect
the couple's love and to strengthen their indissoluble unity. By this

grace they "help one another to attain holiness in their married life

and in welcoming and educating their children. " 148

1642
Christ is the source of this grace. "Just as of old God encountered his people with a covenant of love and fidelity, so o u r Savior,
the spouse of the Church, now encounters Christian spouses
through the sacrament of Matrimony." 149 Christ dwells with them,

gives them the strength to take up their crosses and so follow him,
to rise again after they have fallen, to forgive one another, to bear one

Christ," 1 50 and to love one another with supemahtral, tender, and
fmitful love.

In the joys of their love and family life he gives them here

on earth a foretaste of the wedding feast of the Lamb:
How can I ever express the happiness of a marriage joined by
the Church, strengthened by an offering, sealed by a blessing,
announced by angels, and ratified by the Father? . . . How
wonderful the bond between two believers, now one in
hope, one in desire, one in discipline, one in the same service!
They are both children of one Father and servants of the
same Master, undivided in spirit and flesh, truly two in one
flesh. Where the flesh is one, one also is the spirit. 151

THE GOODS AND REQUIREMENTS OF CONJUGAL LOVE

1643

"Conjugal love involves a totality, in which all the ele-

ments of the person enter - appeal of the body and instinct, power
of feeling and affectivity, aspiration of the spirit and of will. It aims
at a deeply personal unity, a unity that, beyond union in one flesh,
leads to forming one heart and soul; it demands indissolubility and
faithfulness in definitive mutual givmg; and it is open to fertility. In
a word it is a question of the normal characteristics of all natural
conjugal love, but with a new significance which not only purifies
and strengthens them, but raises them to the extent of making them
the expression of specifically Christian values ." 152

The unity and indissolubility of marria g e
1644

The love of the spouses requires, of its very nature, the

unity and indissolubility of the spouses' community of persons,
which embraces their entire life: "so they are no longer two, but one
flesh ." 153 They "are called to grow continually in their communion
through day-to-day fidelity to their marriage promise of total

mutual self-giving." 154 This human communion is confirmed, pu­
rified, and completed by communion irl Jesus Christ, given
through the sacrament of Matrimony. It is deepened by lives of the
common faith and by the Eucharist received together.

"The unity of marriage, dis tinctly recognized b y our Lord,

is made clear in the equal personal dignity which must be accorded
to man and wife in mutual and unreserved affection." 155 Polygamy

369

The fidelity of conjugal love

2364-2365

is contrary to conjugal love which is undivided and exclusive.l 56

1646

By its very nature conjugal love requires the inviolable

fidelity of the spouses . This is the consequence of the gift of them­

selves which they make to each other. Love seeks to be definitive;

it cannot be an arrangement "until further notice ." The "intimate

union of marriage, as a mutual giving of two persons, and the good

of the children, demand total fidelity from the spouses and require
an unbreakable union between them. " 1 57

1647

The deepest reason is found in the fidelity of God to his

covenant, in that of Christ to his Church. Through the sacrament

of Matrimony the spouses are enabled to represent this fidelity and

witness to it. Through the sacrament, the ind issolubility of mar­
riage receives a new and deeper meaning.

1648

It can seem difficult, even impossible, to bind oneself for

life to another human being. This makes it all the more important
to proclaim the Good News that God loves us with a definitive and
irrevocable love, that married couples share in this love, that it

supports and sustains them, and that by their own faithfulness they

can be witnesses to God's faithful love . Spouses who with God's

grace give this witness, often in very difficult condi tions, deserve
the gratitude and support of the ecclesial community. 158

1649

Yet there are some situations in which living together becomes
practically impossible for a variety of reasons. In such cases the Church
permits the physical separation of the couple and their living apart. The
spouses do not cease to be husband and wife before God and so are not
free to contract a new union.In this difficult situation, the best solution
would be, if possible, reconciliation. The Christian community is called to
help these persons live out their situation in a Christian manner and in
159
fidelity to their marriage bond which remains indissoluble.

1650

Today there are numerous Catholics in many countries who have
recourse to civil divorce and contract new civil unions. In fidelity to the
words of Jesus Christ - "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another,
commits adultery against her; and if she divorces her husband and marries

another, she commits adultery" 1 0 - the Church maintains that a new
union cannot be recognized as valid, if the first marriage was. If the
divorced are remarried civilly, they find themselves in a situation that
objectively contravenes God's law. Consequently, they cannot receive
Eucharistic communion as long as this situation persists. For the same
reason, they cannot exercise certain ecclesial responsibilities. Reconcili­
ation through the sacrament of Penance can be granted only to those who
have repented for having violated the sign of the covenant and of fidelity
to Christ, and who are committed to living in complete continence.

1651
Toward Christians who live in this situation, and who often keep
the faith and desire to bring up their children in a Christian manner, priests
and the whole community must manifest an attentive solicitude, so that
they do not consider themselves separated from the Church, in whose life
they can and must participate as baptized persons:
They should be encouraged to listen to the Word of God, to
attend the Sacrifice of the Mass, to persevere in prayer, to
contribute to works of charity and to community efforts for
justice, to bring up their children in the Christian faith, to
cultivate the spirit and practice of penance and thus implore,
l6
day by day, God's grace. 1

2366-2367 The openness to fertility
1652
"By its very nature the institution of marriage and married
love is ordered to the procreation and education of the offspring
and it is in them that it finds its crowning glory." 162

372

Children are the supreme gift of marriage and contribute
greatly to the good of the parents themselves.God himself
said: "It is not good that man should be alone," and "from
the beginning [he] made them male and female"; wishing to
associate them in a special way in his own creative work,
God blessed man and woman with the words: "Be fruitful
and multiply." Hence, true married love and the whole
structure of family life which results from it, without dimin­
ishment of the other ends of marriage, are directed to dis­
posing the spouses to cooperate valiantly with the love of
the Creator and Savior, who throu h them will increase and
63
enrich his family from day to day.

f

1653
The fruitfulness of conjugal love extends to the fruits of the
moral, spiritual, and supernatural life that parents hand on to their
children by education. Parents are the principal and first educators
of their children.l 64 In this sense the fundamental task of marriage
2231 and family is to be at the service of life_l 65

Christian terms. Their marriage can radiate a fruitfulness of charity,
of hospitality, and of sacrifice.
VI.

THE DOMESTIC CHURCH

1655
Christ chose to be born and grow up in the bosom of the
holy family of Joseph and Mary. The Church is nothing other than
"the family of God." From the beginning, the core of the Church 759
was often constituted by those who had become believers "together
with all [their] household ."l 66 When they were converted, they
desired that "their whole household" should also be saved. 167
These families who became believers were islands of Christian life
in an unbelieving world.
1656

In our own time, in a world often alien and even hostile to
faith, believing families are of primary importance as centers of living,
radiant faith. For this reason the Second Vatican Council, using an
ancient expression, calls the family the Ecclesia domestica. 168 It is in the
bosom of the family that parents are "by word and example . . . the 2204
first heralds of the faith with regard to their children. They should
encourage them in the vocation which is proper to each child, fostering with special care any religious vocation." 169
1657
It is here that the father of the family, the mother, children,
and all members of the family exercise the priesthood of the baptized in
a privileged way "by the reception of the sacraments, prayer and 1268
thanksgiving, the witness of a holy life, and self-denial and active
charity. " 170 Thus the home is the first school of Christian life and "a 22 14-2231
school for human enrichment." 171 Here one learns endurance and the
joy of work, fraternal love, generous - even repeated - forgiveness,
and above all divine worship in prayer and the offering of one's life. 2685
1658
We must also remember the great number of single perso ns
who, because of the particular circumstances in which they have to
live - often not of their choosing - are especially close to Jesus' heart
and therefore deserve the special affection and active solicitude of the

often due to conditions of poverty. Some live their situation in the

fashion. The doors of homes, the " domestic churches, " and of the great
family which is the Church must be open to all of them. "No one is

form with each other an intimate communion of life
and love, has been founded and endowed with its own
special laws by the Creator. By its very nature it is
ordered to the good of the couple, as well as to the
generation and education of children. Christ the Lord
raised marriage between the baptized to the dignity of
a sacrament (d. CIC, can. 1055 § 1; d. GS 48 § 1).

1661

The sacrament of Matrimony signifies the union of
Christ and the Church. It gives spouses the grace to
love each other with the love with which Christ has
loved his Church; the grace of the sacrament thus
perfects the human love of the spouses, strengthens
their indissoluble unity, and sanctifies them on the
way to eternal life (d. Council of Trent: DS 1799).

1662

Marriage is based on the consent of the contracting
parties, that is, on their will to give themselves, each
to the other, mutually and definitively, in order to live
a covenant of faithful and fruitful love.

1663

Since marriage establishes the couple in a public state of
life in the Church, it is fitting that its celebration be public,
in the framework of a liturgical celebration, before the
priest (or a witness authorized by the Church), the wit­
nesses, and the assembly of the faithful.

1664

Unity, indissolubility, and openness to fertility are
essential to marriage. Polygamy is incompatible with
the unity of marriage; divorce separates what God has

172 FC 85; cf. Mt 1 1 :28.

joined together; the refusal of fertility turns married
life away from its "supreme gift," the child

1665

(GS 50 § 1 ) .

The remarriage of persons divorced from a living,
lawful spouse contravenes the plan and law of God as

taught by Christ . They are not separated from the

Church, but they cannot receive Eucharistic commun­

ion. They will lead Christian lives especially by edu­

cating their children

1666

in the faith.

The Christian home is the place where child ren receive

the first proclamation of the faith. For this reason the
family home is rightly called "the domes tic church," a

community of grace and prayer, a school of human
virtues and of Christian charity.

SACRAMENTALS

1667

"Holy Mother Church has, moreover, instituted sacramen­

tals . These are sacred signs which bear a resemblance to the sacra­

ments. They signify effects, par ticularly of a spiritual nature, which
are obtained through the intercession of the Church . By them men

are disposed to receive the chief effect of the sacraments, and
various occasions in life are rendered holy." 1 73

The characteristics of sacramentals
1668

Sacramentals are instituted for the sanctification of certain

ministries of the Church, certain states of life, a great variety of

circumstances in Christian life, and the use of many things helpful
to man.

In accordance

with bishops' pastoral decisions, they can

also respond to the needs, culture, and special history of the Chris­
tian people of a particular region or time. They always include a

prayer, often accompanied by a specific sign, such as the laying on
of hands, the sign of the cross, or the sprinkling of holy water
(which recalls Baptism) .

Sacramentals derive from the baptismal priesthood: every
2626 bap tized person is called to be a "blessing," and to bless. 1 74 Hence
lay people may preside at certain blessings; the more a blessing
concerns ecclesial and sacramental life, the more is its adminis tra­
tion reserved to the ordained ministry (bishops, priests, or dea­

cons) . 1 75

1 128 1670

Sacramentals do not confer the grace of the Holy Spirit in

the way that the sacraments do, but by the Church's prayer, they
prepare us to receive grace and dispose us to cooperate with i t . "For

2001

well-disposed members of the faithful, the li turgy of the sacra­
ments and sacramentals sanctifies almost every event of their lives
with the d ivine grace which flows from the Paschal mystery of the
Passion, Dea th, and Resurrection of Christ . From this source all
sacraments and sacramentals draw their power. There is scarcely
any proper use of material things which cannot be thus directed
toward the sanctification of men and the praise of God. " 1 76

Various forms of sacramentals
1 078 1671

Among sacramentals blessings (of persons, meals, objects, and
places) come first. Every blessing praises God and prays for his gifts. In
Christ, Christians are blessed by God the Father "with every spiritual
blessing." 177 This is why the Church imparts blessings by invoking the
name of Jesus, usually while making the holy sign of the cross of Christ.

1672
Certain blessings have a lasting importance because they conse­
crate persons to God, or reserve objects and places for liturgical use.

923, 925
903

395
550
1 237

Among those blessings which are intended for persons - not to be con­
fused with sacramental ordination - are the blessing of the abbot or abbess
of a monastery, the consecration of virgins and widows, the rite of religious
profession and the blessing of certain ministries of the Church (readers,
acolytes, catechists, etc.). The dedication or blessing of a church or an altar,
the blessing of holy oils, vessels, and vestments, bells, etc., can be men­
tioned as examples of blessings that concern objects.

1673
When the Church asks publicly and authoritatively in the name
of Jesus Christ that a person or object be protected against the power of
the Evil One and withdrawn from his dominion, it is called exorcism. Jesus
performed exorcisms and from him the Church has received the power
and office of exorcizing. 178 In a simple form, exorcism is performed at the
celebration of Baptism. The solemn exorcism, called "a major exorcism,"
can be performed only by a priest and with the permission of the bishop.
The priest must proceed with prudence, strictly observing the rules estab174

lished b y the Church. Exorcism i s directed at the expulsion of demons o r
t o the liberation from demonic possession through the spiritual authority
which Jesus entrusted to his Church. Illness, especially psychological illness,
is a very different matter; treating this is the concern of medical science.
Therefore, before an exorcism is performed, it is important to ascertain that
9
one is dealing with the presence of the Evil One, and not an illness. 17

Popular piety
1674
Besides sacramental liturgy and sacramentals, catechesis
must take into account the forms of piety and popular devotions 2688
among the faithful. The religious sense of the Christian people has
always found expression in various forms of piety surrounding the
Church's sacramental life, such as the veneration of relics, visits to
sanctuaries, pilgrimages, processions, the stations of the cross,
2669, 2678
religious dances, the rosary, medals, 1 80 etc.
1675
These expressions of piety extend the liturgical life of the Church,
but do not replace it. They "should be so drawn up that they harmonize
with the liturgical seasons, accord with the sacred liturgy, are in some way
derived from it and lead the people to it, since in fact the liturgy by its very
nature is far superior to any of them ." 1 8 1
1676
Pastoral discernment i s needed t o sustain a n d support popular
piety and, if necessary, to purify and correct the religious sense which
underlies these devotions so that the faithful may advance in knowledge
of the mystery of Christ. 182 Their exercise is subject to the care and
judgment of the bishops and to the general norms of the Church.
At its core the piety of the people is a storehouse of values
that offers answers of Christian wisdom to the great ques­
tions of life. The Catholic wisdom of the people is capable of
fashioning a vital synthesis . . . . It creatively combines the
divine and the human, Christ and Mary, spirit and body,
communion and institution, person and community, faith
and homeland, intelligence and emotion. This wisdom is a
Christian humanism that radically affirms the dignity of
every person as a child of God, establishes a basic fraternity,
teaches people to encounter nature and understand work,
provides reasons for joy and humor even in the midst of a
very hard life. For the people this wisdom is also a principle
of discernment and an evangelical instinct through which
they spontaneously sense when the Gospel is served in the
Church and when it is emptied of its content and stifled by
other interests. 183

I N BRIEF
1677

Sacramentals are sacred signs instituted by the

Church . They prepare men to receive the fruit of the
sacraments and sanctify different circumstances of
life.

1678

Among the sacramentals blessings occupy an impor­
tant place. They include both praise of God for his

works and gifts, and the Church's intercession for men

that they may be able to use God 's gifts according to

the spirit of the Gospel.

1679

In addition to the liturgy, Christian life is nourished

by various forms of popular piety, rooted in the differ­
ent cultures. While carefully clarifying them in the

light of faith, the Church fosters the forms of popular

piety that express an evangelical instinct and a human

wisdom and that enrich Christian life.

CHRISTIAN FUNERALS

1 525 1680

All the sacraments, and principally those of Christian in-

itiation, have as their goal the last Passover of the child of God

which, through death, leads him into the life of the Kingdom. Then

what he confessed in faith and hope will be fulfilled:

"I look for the

resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. " 184

THE CHRISTIAN'S LAST PASS OVER
The Christian meaning of death is revealed in the light of

the Paschal mystery of the death and resurrection of Christ in whom
resides our only hope. The Christian who dies in Christ Jesus is
"away from the body and at home with the Lord." 185

1682

For the Christian the day of death inaugurates,

at the end of

his sacramental life, the fulfillment of his new birth begun at Baptism,
the definitive "conformity" to "the image of the Son" conferred by

184 Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed.

the anointing of the Holy Spirit, and participation in the feast of the
Kingdom which was anticipated in the Eucharist - even if final
purifications are still necessary for him in order to be clothed with
the nuptial garment.
1683
The Church who, as Mother, has borne the Christian sac­
ramentally in her womb during his earthly pilgrimage, accompanies him at his journey's end, in order to surrender him "into the 1 020
Father's hands." She offers to the Father, in Christ, the child of his
grace, and she commits to the earth, in hope, the seed of the body
that will rise in glory. 1 86 This offering is fully celebrated in the 62 7
Eucharistic sacrifice; the blessings before and after Mass are sacra­
mentals .
II.

THE CELEBRATION OF fUNERALS

1684
The Christian funeral is a liturgical celebration of the Church. The
ministry of the Church in this instance aims at expressing efficacious
communion with the deceased, at the participation in that communion of
the community gathered for the funeral, and at the proclamation of eternal
life to the community.
1685
The different funeral rites express the Paschal character of Chris­
tian death and are in keeping with the situations and traditions of each
region, even as to the color of the liturgical vestments worn. 187
1686

The Order of Christian Funerals (Ordo exseq u iarum) of the Roman
liturgy gives three types of funeral celebrations, corresponding to the three
places in which they are conducted (the home, the church, and the ceme­
tery), and according to the importance attached to them by the family, local
customs, the culture, and popular piety. This order of celebration is
common to all the liturgical traditions and comprises four principal ele­
ments:

1687
The greeting of the community. A greeting of faith begins the celebra­
tion. Relatives and friends of the deceased are welcomed with a word of
"consolation" (in the New Testament sense of the Holy Spirit's power in
hope). 188 The community assembling in prayer also awaits the "words of
eternal life." The death of a member of the community (or the anniversary of
a death, or the seventh or thirtieth day after death) is an event that should lead
beyond the perspectives of "this world" and should draw the faithful into the
true perspective of faith in the risen Christ.
1688
The liturgy of the Word during funerals demands very careful
preparation because the assembly present for the funeral may include
some faithful who rarely attend the liturgy, and friends of the deceased
who are not Christians. The homily in particular must "avoid the literary

Tlze Eucharistic Sacrifice. When the celebration takes place in
church, the Eucharist is the heart of the Paschal reality of Christian
90
death. 1
In the Eucharist, the Church expresses her efficacious commun­
ion with the departed: offering to the Father in the Holy Spirit the sacrifice
of the death and resurrection of Christ, she asks to purify his child of his
sins and their consequences, and to admit him to the Paschal fullness of
the table of the Kingdom. 1 9l It is by the Eucharist thus celebrated that the
community of the faithful, especially the family of the deceased, learn to
live in communion with the one who "has fallen asleep in the Lord," by
communicating in the Body of Christ of which he is a living member and,
then, by praying for him and with him.
1690
Afarewell to the deceased is his final "commendation to God" by
the Church. It is "the last farewell by which the Christian community
92
greets one of its members before his body is brought to its tomb. " 1 The
Byzantine tradition expresses this by the kiss of farewell to the deceased:
By this final greeting "we sing for his departure from this
life and separation from us, but also because there is a
communion and a reunion. For even dead, we are not at all
separated from one another, because we all run the same
course and we will find one another again in the same place.
We shall never be separated, for we live for Christ, and now
we are united with Christ as we go toward him . . . we shall
93
all be together in Christ." 1

Christ in glory, portrayed very young as a sign of his divinity, is seated on the
throne of heaven, with Uranus, the pagan god of heaven, as his footstool. The
apostles Peter and Paul stand on either side of Christ, toward whom they are
turning and from whom they receive two scrolls: the new law.
As Moses had received the old law from God on Mount Sinai, now the apostles,
represented by their two leaders, receive from Christ, the Son of God, the Lord
of heaven and earth, the new law, no longer written on tablets of stone, but
engraved by the Holy Spirit on the hearts of believers. Christ gives the strength
to live according to the "new life" (§1697). He fulfills in us what he has com­
manded for our benefit (d. §2074).

LIFE IN CHRIST
1691
"Christian, recognize your dignity and, now that you
share in God's own nature, do not return to your former base
condition by sinning. Remember who is your head and of whose
body you are a member. Never forget that you have been rescued 790
from the power of darkness and brought into the light of the
Kingdom of God."1
1692
The Symbol of the faith confesses the greatness of God's
gifts to man in his wor� of creation, and even more in redemption
and sanctification. What faith confesses, the sacraments commu­
nicate: by the sacraments of rebirth, Christians have become "chil­
dren of God,"2 "partakers of the divine nature." 3 Coming to see in
the faith their new dignity, Christians are called to lead henceforth
a life "worthy of the gospel of Christ."4 They are made capable of
doing so by the grace of Christ and the gifts of his Spirit, which they
receive through the sacraments and through prayer.
1693
Christ Jesus always did what was pleasing to the Father,S
and always lived in perfect communion with him. Likewise
Christ's disciples are invited to live in the sight of the Father "who
sees in secret,"6 in order to become "perfect as your heavenly
Father is perfect."7
Incorporated into Christ by Baptism, Christians are "dead 1 267
1694
to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus" and so participate in the life
of the Risen Lord. 8 Following Christ and united with him,9 Chris-

1695
"Justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the
Spirit of our God," 13 "sanctified . . . [and] called to be saints," 14
Christians have become the temple of the Holy Spirit. 15 This "Spirit
of the Son" teaches them to pray to the Father16 and, having
become their life, prompts them to act so as to bear "the fruit of the
Spirit" 17 by charity in action. Healing the wormds of sin, the Holy
Spirit renews us interiorly through a spiritual transforrnation.18 He
enlightens and strengthens us to live as " children of light" through
"all that is good and right and true." 19
1696
The way of Christ "leads to life"; a contrary way "leads to
destruction. " 20 The Gospel parable of the two ways remains ever
1 970 present in the catechesis of the Church; it shows the importance of
moral decisions for our salvation: "There are two ways, the one of
life, the other of death; but between the two, there is a great
difference. " 2 1
1697
Catechesis has to reveal in all clarity the joy and the de­
mands of the way of Christ. 22 Catechesis for the "newness of life" 23
in him should be:

to Christ, a gentle guest and friend who inspires, guides, corrects,
and strengthens this life;

"spiritual goods" in the "communion of saints" that Christian life
can grow, develop, and be communicated.

1698
The first and last point of reference of this catechesis will
always be Jesus Christ himself, who is "the way, and the truth, and
the life. " 24 It is by looking to him in faith that Christ's faithful can
hope that he himself fulfills his promises in them, and that, by
loving him with the same love with which he has loved them, they
may perform works in keeping with their dignity:
I ask you to consider that our Lord Jesus Christ is your true
head, and that you are one of his members. He belongs to
you as the head belongs to its members; all that is his is yours:
his spirit, his heart, his body and soul, and all his faculties.
You must make use of all these as of your own, to serve,
praise, love, and glorify God. You belong to him, as members
belong to their head. And so he longs for you to use all that
is in you, as if it were his own, for the service and glory of
the Father. 25

MAN'S VO CATION
LIFE IN THE S PIRIT

Life in the Holy Spirit fulfills the vocation of man (chapter

(chapter two). It is graciously offered as salvation (chapter three).

C HAPTER ONE
THE D IGNITY OF THE HUMAN PERSON

356 1700

1439

The dignity of the human person is rooted in his creation
in the image and likeness of God (article 1 ); it is fulfilled in his
vocation to divine beatitude (article 2). It is essential to a human
being freely to direct himself to this fulfillment (article 3). By his
deliberate actions (article 4), the human person does, or does not,
conform to the good promised by God and attested by moral
conscience (article 5). Human beings make their own contribution
to their interior growth; they make their whole sentient and spiri­
tual lives into means of this growth (article 6). With the help of grace
they grow in virtue (article 7), avoid sin, and if they sin they entrust
themselves as did the prodigal son l to the mercy of our Father in
heaven (article 8). In this way they attain to the perfection of charity.

ARTICLE 1
MAN: THE IMAGE OF GOD

359 1701

"Christ, . . . in the very revelation of the mystery of the
Father and of his love, makes man fully manifest to himself and
brings to light his exalted vocation." 2 It is in Christ, "the image of
the invisible God," 3 that man has been created "in the image and
likeness" of the Creator. It is in Christ, Redeemer and Savior, that
the divine image, disfigured in man by the first sin, has been
restored to its original beauty and ennobled by the grace of God. 4

The divine image is present in every man. It shines forth 1878
in the communion of persons, in the likeness of the unity of the
divine persons among themselves (cf. chapter two) .
1703
Endowed with "a spiritual and immortal" soul,s the hu- 363
man person is "the only creature on earth that God has willed for
its own sake." 6 From his conception, he is destined for eternal 2258
beatitude.
1704

The human person participates in the light and power of
the divine Spirit. By his reason, he is capable of understanding the
order of things established by the Creator. By free will, he is capable 339
of directing himself toward his true good. He finds his perfection
30
"in seeking and loving what is true and good ." 7
1705
By virtue of his soul and his spiritual powers of intellect
and will, man is endowed with freedom, an "outstanding manifes- 1 730
tation of the divine image." 8
1706
By his reason, man recognizes the voice of God which
urges him "to do what is good and avoid what is evil."9 Everyone
is obliged to follow this law, which makes itself heard in conscience
and is fulfilled in the love of God and of neighbor. Living a moral 1 776
life bears witness to the dignity of the person.
1707
"Man, enticed by the Evil One, abused his freedom at the
very beginning of history." 1 0 He succumbed to temptation and did
what was evil. He still desires the good, but his nature bears the 397
wound of original sin. He is now inclined to evil and subject to
error:
Man is divided in himself. As a result, the whole life of men,
both individual and social, shows itself to be a struggle, and
a dramatic one, between good and evil, between light and
darkness. 1 1

By his Passion, Christ delivered us from Satan and from 61 7
sin. He merited for us the new life in the Holy Spirit. His grace
restores what sin had damaged in us.

He who believes in Christ becomes a son of God. This filial
adoption transforms him by giving him the ability to follow the

good. In union with his Savior, the disciple attains the perfection
of charity which is holiness. Having matured in grace, the moral
life blossoms into eternal life in the glory of heaven.

The Beatitudes are at the heart of Jesus' preaching. They
take up the promises made to the chosen people since Abraham.
The Beatitudes fulfill the promises by ordering them no longer
merely to the possession of a territory, but to the Kingdom of
heaven:

1716

Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
for they shall be satisfied.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God .
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of
God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness'
sake,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you
and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.
Rejoice and be glad,
for your reward is great in heaven. 12

2546

The Beatitudes depict the countenance of Jesus Christ and 459
portray his charity. They express the vocation of the faithful asso­
ciated with the glory of his Passion and Resurrection; they shed
light on the actions and attitudes characteristic of the Christian life;
they are the paradoxical promises that sustain hope in the midst of
tribulations; they proclaim the blessings and rewards already se- 1 820
cured, however dimly, for Christ's disciples; they have begun in
the lives of the Virgin Mary and all the saints.
1717

II.

THE DESIRE FOR HAPPINESS

1718
The Beatitudes respond to the natural desire for happiness.
This desire is of divine origin: God has placed it in the human heart 27, 1 024
in order to draw man to the One who alone can fulfill it:
We all want to live happily; in the whole human race there
is no one who does not assent to this proposition, even before
it is fully articulated . 13
How is it, then, that I seek you, Lord? Since in seeking you,
my God, I seek a happy life, let me seek you so that my soul
may live, for my body draws life from my soul and my soul
draws life from you. I4
God alone satisfies. 15

Part Three

428

The Beatitudes reveal the goal of human existence, the
ultimate end of human acts: God calls us to his own beatitude. This
vocation is addressed to each individual personally, but also to the
Church as a whole, the new people made up of those who have
accepted the promise and live from it in faith.

CHRISTIAN BEATITUDE

The New Testament uses several expressions to characterize the beatitude to which God calls man:

1 027 1720

- the coming of the Kingdom of God; 16
- the vision of God: "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall
see God" ; 17
- entering into the joy of the Lord;18
- entering into God's rest: 19
There we shall rest and see, we shall see and love, we shall
love and praise. Behold what will be at the end without end.
For what other end do we have, if not to reach the kingdom
which has no end? 20

1721
God put us in the world to know, to love, and to serve him ,
and so to come to paradise. Beatitude makes us "partakers of the
divine nature" and of etemal life. 21 With beatitude, man enters into
260 the glory of Christ22 and into the joy of the Trinitarian life.
1722
Such beatitude surpasses the understanding and powers
of man. It comes from an entirely free gift of God: whence it is called
1028 supernatural, as is the grace that disposes man to enter into the
divine joy.
"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God ." It is
true, because of the greatness and inexpressible glory of God,
that "man shall not see me and live," for the Father cannot
be grasped . But because of God's love and goodness toward
us, and because he can do all things, he goes so far as to grant
those who love him the privilege of seeing him . . . . For "what
is impossible for men is possible for God."23

429

1723
The beatitude we are promised confronts us with decisive
moral choices. It invites us to purify our hearts of bad instincts and
to seek the love of God above all else. It teaches us that true 251 9
happiness is not found in riches or well-being, in human fame or
power, or in any human achievement - however beneficial it may
be - such as science, technology, and art, or indeed in any creature,
but in God alone, the source of every good and of all love:
227
A l l bow down before wealth. Wealth i s that t o which the
multitude of men pay an instinctive homage. They measure
happiness by wealth; and by wealth they measure respectability.. . . It is a homage resulting from a profound faith . . .
that with wealth he may do all things. Wealth is one idol of
the day and notoriety is a second . . . . Notoriety, or the
making of a noise in the world - it may be called "newspaper
fame" - has come to be considered a great good in itself, and
2
a ground of veneration. 4

1724
The Decalogue, the Sermon on the Mount, and the apos­
tolic catechesis describe for us the paths that lead to the Kingdom
of heaven. Sustained by the grace of the Holy Spirit, we tread them,
step by step, by everyday acts. By the working of the Word of
Christ, we slowly bear fruit in the Church to the glory of God. 25

IN BRIEF

1725

The Beatitudes take up and fulfill God's promises
from Abraham on by ordering them to the Kingdom
of heaven. They respond to the desire for happiness
that God has placed in the human heart.

1726

The Beatitudes teach us the final end to which God
calls us: the Kingdom, the vision of God, participation
in the divine nature, eternal life, filiation, rest in God.

1727

The beatitude of eternal life is a gratuitous gift of God.
It is supernatural, as is the grace that leads us there.

1728

The Beatitudes confront us with decisive choices con­
cerning earthly goods; they purify our hearts in order
to teach us to love God above all things.

Principle," in Discourses to Mixed Congregations (London: Longmans, Green
and Co., 1906) V, 89-90.
25 Cf. the parable of the sower: Mt 13:3-23.

1729

The beatitude of heaven sets the standards for discern­
ment in the use of earthly goods in keeping with the
law of God.

ARTICLE 3
MAN ' S FREEDOM

1730
God created man a rational being, conferring on him the
dignity of a person who can initiate and control his own actions.
"God willed that man should be 'left in the hand of his own
counsel,' so that he might of his own accord seek his Creator and
30 freely attain his full and blessed perfection by cleaving to him . "26
Man is rational and therefore like God; he is created with free
will and is master over his acts. 27

I.

FREEDOM AND RESPONSIBILITY

1731
Freedom is the power, rooted in reason and will, to act or
not to act, to do this or that, and so to perform deliberate actions
on one's own responsibility. By free will one shapes one's own life.
Human freedom is a force for growth and maturity in truth and
1 72 1 goodness; it attains its perfection when directed toward God, our
beatitude.
1732

As long as freedom has not bound itself definitively to its

396 ultimate good which is God, there is the possibility of choosing
1 849 between good and evil, and thus of growing in perfection or of failing
and sinning. This freedom characterizes properly human acts. It is

2006 the basis of praise or blame, merit or reproach.

The more one does what is good, the freer one becomes.
There is no true freedom except in the service of what is good and
just. The choice to disobey and do evil is an abuse of freedom and
leads to "the slavery of sin. "28

1 803 1733

1 036 1734
Freedom makes man responsible for his acts to the extent
1 804 that they are voluntary. Progress in virtue, knowledge of the good,
and ascesis enhance the mastery of the will over its acts.
26 GS 17; Sir 15:14.
27 St. lrenaeus, Adv. haeres. 4, 4, 3: PG 7/1, 983.
28 Cf. Rom 6:17.

Life in Christ

431

1735
Imputability and responsibility for an action can be dimin­
ished or even nullified by ignorance, inadvertence, duress, fear, habit,
inordinate attachments, and other psychological or social factors.
597
1736

Every act directly willed is imputable to its author:

2568

Thus the Lord asked Eve after the sin in the garden: "What is this
that you have done?" 29 He asked Cain the same question. 30 The prophet
N athan questioned David in the same way after he committed adultery
with the wife of Uriah and had him murdered.31
An action can be indirectly voluntary when it results from negli­
gence regarding something one should have known or done: for example,
an accident arising from ignorance of traffic laws.

1737
An effect can be toler ated without being willed by its agent; for 2263
instance, a mother's exhaustion from tending her sick child. A bad effect
is not imputable if it was not willed either as an end or as a means of an
action, e.g., a death a person incurs in aiding someone in danger. For a bad
effect to be imputable it must be foreseeable and the agent must have the
possibility of avoiding it, as in the case of manslaughter caused by a
drunken driver.
1738
Freedom is exercised in relationships between human beings. Every human person, created in the image of God, has the
natural right to be recognized as a free and responsible being. All
owe to each other this duty of respect. The right to the exercise of
freedom, especially in moral and religious matters, is an inalienable
requirement of the dignity of the human person. This right must 2 1 06
be recognized and protected by civil authority within the limits of
2109
the common good and public order. 32

II.

H UMAN FREEDOM IN THE ECONOMY OF SALVATION

1739
Freedom and sin. Man's freedom is limited and fallible. In 387
fact, man failed. He freely sinned. By refusing God's plan of love,
he deceived himself and became a slave to sin. This first alienation
engendered a multitude of others. From its outset, human history 401
attests the wretchedness and oppression born of the human heart
in consequence of the abuse of freedom.

432

Part Three

Threats to freedom. The exercise of freedom does not imply
a right to say or do everything. It is false to maintain that man, "the
subject of this freedom," is "an individual who is fully self-suffi­
cient and whose finality is the satisfaction of his own interests in
the enj oyment of earthly goods." 33 Moreover, the economic, social,
political, and cultural conditions that are needed for a just exercise
of freedom are too often disregarded or violated. Such situations
1 887 of blindness and injustice injure the moral life and involve the
strong as well as the weak in the temptation to sin against charity.
By deviating from the moral law man violates his own freedom,
becomes imprisoned within himself, disrupts neighborly fellow­
ship, and rebels against divine truth.

2108 1740

1741
Liberation and salvation. By his glorious Cross Christ has
won salvation for all men. He redeemed them from the sin that held
them in bondage. "For freedom Christ has set us free." 34 In him we
782 have communion with the "truth that makes us free." 35 The Holy
Spirit has been given to us and, as the Apostle teaches, "Where the
Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom." 36 Already we glory in the
"liberty of the children of God." 37
1742
Freedom and grace. The grace of Christ is not in the slightest
way a rival of our freedom when this freedom accords with the
2002 sense of the true and the good that God has put in the human heart.
On the contrary, as Christian experience attests especially in
prayer, the more docile we are to the promptings of grace, the more
we grow in inner freedom and confidence during trials, such as
1 784 those we face in the pressures and constraints of the outer world.
By the working of grace the Holy Spirit educates us in spiritual
freedom in order to make us free collaborators in his work in the
Church and in the world:
Almighty and merciful God,
in your goodness take away from us all that is harmful,
so that, made ready both in mind and body,
we may freely accomplish your will. 38

IN BRIEF
1743

"God willed that man should be left in the hand of his
own counsel (cf. Sir 15: 14), so that he might of his own
accord seek his creator and freely attain his full and
blessed perfection by cleaving to him" (GS 17 § 1).

1744

Freedom is the power to act or not to act, and so to
perform deliberate acts of one's own. Freedom attains
perfection in its acts when directed toward God, the
sovereign Good.

1745

Freedom characterizes properly human acts. It makes
the human being responsible for acts of which he is the
voluntary agent. His deliberate acts properly belong
to him.

1746

The imputability or responsibility for an action can be
diminished or nullified by ignorance, duress, fear, and
other psychological or social factors.

1747

The right to the exercise of freedom, especially in
religious and moral matters, is an inalienable require­
ment of the dignity of man. But the exercise of freedom
does not entail the putative right to say or do anything.

1748

"For freedom Christ has set us free" (Gal 5:1).

ARTICLE 4
THE MORALITY OF HUMAN ACTS

1749
Freedom makes man a moral subject. When he acts delib­
erately, man is, so to speak, the father of his acts. Human acts, that
is, acts that are freely chosen in consequence of a judgment of 1 732
conscience, can be morally evaluated. They are either good or evil.

I.

THE SOURCES OF MORALITY

1750

The morality of human acts depends on:

- the object chosen;
- the end in view or the intention;
- the circumstances of the action.

434

Part Three

The object, the intention, and the circumstances make up
the "sources," or constitutive elements, of the morality of human
acts.
The object chosen is a good toward which the will deliber­
ately directs itself. It is the matter of a human act. The object chosen
morally specifies the act of the will, insofar as reason recognizes
and judges it to be or not to be in conformity with the true good.
Objective norms of morality express the rational order of good and
1 794 evil, attested to by conscience.
1751

1752
In contrast to the object, the intention resides in the acting
subject. Because it lies at the voluntary source of an action and
determines it by its end, intention is an element essential to the
moral evaluation of an action. The end is the first goal of the
2520 intention and indicates the purpose pursued in the action. The
intention is a movement of the will toward the end: it is concerned
with the goal of the activity. It aims at the good anticipated from
the action undertaken. Intention is not limited to directing individ­
ual actions, but can guide several actions toward one and the same
purpose; it can orient one's whole life toward its ultimate end. For
1 731 example, a service done with the end of helping one's neighbor can
at the same time be inspired by the love of God as the ultimate end
of all our actions. One and the same action can also be inspired by
several intentions, such as performing a service in order to obtain
a favor or to boast about it.
1753
A good intention (for example, that of helping one's neigh­
bor) does not make behavior that is intrinsically disordered, such
as lying and calumny, good or just. The end does not justify the
2479 means. Thus the condemnation of an innocent person cannot be
justified as a legitimate means of saving the nation. On the other
596 hand, an added bad intention (such as vainglory) makes an act evil
that, in and of itself, can be good (such as almsgiving).39

The circumstances, including the consequences, are secon­
dary elements of a moral act. They contribute to increasing or
diminishing the moral goodness or evil of human acts (for exam­
ple, the amount of a theft). They can also diminish or increase the
agent's responsibility (such as acting out of a fear of death). Cir1 735 cumstances of themselves cannot change the moral quality of acts
themselves; they can make neither good nor right an action that is
in itself evil.
1754

39

Cf. Mt 6:2-4.

Life in Christ
II.

435

GooD ACTS AND EVIL ACTS

1755
A morally good act requires the goodness of the object, of
the end, and of the circumstances together. An evil end corrupts
the action, even if the object is good in itself (such as praying and
fasting "in order to be seen by men").
The object of the choice can by itself vitiate an act in its
entirety. There are some concrete acts - such as fornication - that
it is always wrong to choose, because choosing them entails a
disorder of the will, that is, a moral evil.

It is therefore an error to judge the morality of human acts
by considering only the intention that inspires them or the circum­
stances (environment, social pressure, duress or emergency, etc.)
which supply their context. There are acts which, in and of them­
selves, independently of circumstances and intentions, are always
gravely illicit by reason of their object; such as blasphemy and
perjury, murder and adultery. One may not do evil so that good 1 789
may result from it.
1756

IN BRIEF
1757

The object, the intention, and the circumstances make
up the three "sources" of the morality of human acts.

1758

The object chosen morally specifies the act of willing
accordingly as reason recognizes and judges it good
or eviL

1759

"An evil action cannot be justified by reference to a

good intention" (cf. St. Thomas Aquinas, Dec. praec. 6).
The end does not justify the means.
1760

A morally good act requires the goodness of its object,
of its end, and of its circumstances together.

1761

There are concrete acts that it is always wrong to
choose, because their choice entails a disorder of the
will, i.e., a moral eviL One may not do evil so that good
may result from it.

436

Part Three

ARTICLE 5
THE MORALITY OF THE PASSIONS

1762
The human person is ordered to beatitude by his deliberate
acts: the passions or feelings he experiences can dispose him to it
and contribute to it.

PASSIONS

I.

1763
The term "passions" belongs to the Christian patrimony.
Feelings or passions are emotions or movements of the sensitive
appetite that incline us to act or not to act in regard to something
felt or imagined to be good or evil.
1764
The passions are natural components of the human psy­
che; they form the passageway and ensure the connection between
the life of the senses and the life of the mind. Our Lord called man's
368 heart the source from which the passions spring. 40
1765
There are many passions. The most fundamental passion
is love, aroused by the attraction of the good. Love causes a desire
for the absent good and the hope of obtaining it; this movement
finds completion in the pleasure and joy of the good possessed. The
apprehension of evil causes hatred, aversion, and fear of the im­
pending evil; this movement ends in sadness at some present evil,
or in the anger that resists it.
"To love is to will the good of another." 41 All other affec­
tions have their source in this first movement of the human heart
1 704 toward the good. Only the good can be loved. 42 Passions "are evil
if love is evil and good if it is good." 43
1766

II.

PASSIONS AND MORAL LIFE

1767
In themselves passions are neither good nor evil. They are
morally qualified only to the extent that they effectively engage
1 860 reason and will. Passions are said to be voluntary, "either because
they are commanded by the will or because the will does not place
40 Cf. Mk 7:21.
41 St. Thomas Aquinas, 5Th I-II, 26, 4, corp. art.
42 Cf. St. Augustine, De Trin ., 8, 3, 4: PL 42, 949-950.
43 St. Augustine, De civ. Dei 14, 7, 2: PL 41, 410.

437

Life in Christ

obstacles in their way."44 It belongs to the perfection of the moral
or human good that the passions be governed by reason. 45
Strong feelings are not decisive for the morality or the
holiness of persons; they are simply the inexhaustible reservoir of
images and affections in which the moral life is expressed. Passions
are morally good when they contribute to a good action, evil in the
opposite case. The upright will orders the movements of the senses
it appropriates to the good and to beatitude; an evil will succumbs
to disordered passions and exacerbates them. Emotions and feel1 803, 1 865
ings can be taken up into the virtues or perverted by the vices.

1768

1769

In the Christian life, the Holy Spirit himself accomplishes

his work by mobilizing the whole being, with all its sorrows, fears
and sadness, as is visible in the Lord's agony and passion. In Christ
human feelings are able to reach their consummation in charity and
divine beatitude.
Moral perfection consists in man's being moved to the
good not by his will alone, but also by his sensitive appetite, as in
the words of the psalm: "My heart and flesh sing for joy to the living 30
God." 46

1770

IN BRIEF

1771

The term "passions" refers to the affections or the
feelings. By his emotions man intuits the good and
suspects evil.

1772

The principal passions are love and hatred, desire and
fear, joy, sadness, and anger.

1773

In the passions, as movements of the sensitive appe­

1774

tite, there is neither moral good nor evil. But insofar as
they engage reason and will, there is moral good or
evil in them.
Emotions and feelings can be taken up in the virtues
or perverted by the vices.

44 St. Thomas Aquinas, 5Th I-II, 24, 1 corp. art.
45 Cf. St. Thomas Aquinas, 5Th I-II, 24, 3.
46 Ps 84:2.

1775

The perfection of the moral good consists in man's
being moved to the good not only by his will but also
by his "heart."

ARTICLE 6
MORAL CONS CIENCE

"Deep within his conscience man discovers a law which
1776
he has not laid upon himself but which he must obey. Its voice,
1 954 ever calling him to love and to do what is good and to avoid evil,
sounds in his heart at the right moment. . . . For man has in his heart
a law inscribed by God . . . . His conscience is man's most secret core
and his sanctuary. There he is alone with God whose voice echoes
in his depths." 47

THE JUDGMENT OF CONSCIENCE

I.

Moral conscience, 48 present at the heart of the person,
enjoins him at the appropriate moment to do good and to avoid
evil. It also judges particular choices, approving those that are good
and denouncing those that are evil. 49 It bears witness to the author­
ity of truth in reference to the supreme Good to which the human
1 766 person is drawn, and it welcomes the commandments. When he
2071 listens to his conscience, the prudent man can hear God speaking.

1777

1778
Conscience is a judgment of reason whereby the human
person recognizes the moral quality of a concrete act that he is
1 749 going to perform, is in the process of performing, or has already
completed. In all he says and does, man is obliged to follow
faithfully what he knows to be just and right. It is by the judgment
of his conscience that man perceives and recognizes the prescrip­
tions of the divine law:
Conscience is a law of the mind; yet [Christians] would not
grant that it is nothing more; I mean that it was not a dictate,
nor conveyed the notion of responsibility, of duty, of a threat
and a promise. . . . [Conscience] is a messenger of him, who,
both in nature and in grace, speaks to us behind a veil, and

47 GS 16.
48 Cf. Rom 2:14-16.
49 Cf. Rom 1 :32.

Life in Christ

439

teaches and rules us by his representatives. Conscience is the
aboriginal Vicar of Christ.50

It is important for every person to be sufficiently present
to himself in order to hear and follow the voice of his conscience.
This requirement of interiority is all the more necessary as life often 1 886
distracts us from any reflection, self-examination or introspection:

1779

Return to your conscience, question it. . . . Tum inward, breth­
ren, and in everything you do, see God as your witness. 51

1780
The dignity of the human person implies and requires
uprightness of moral conscience. Conscience includes the perception

of the principles of morality (synderesis); their application in the
given circumstances by practical discernment of reasons and
goods; and finally judgment about concrete acts yet to be per­
formed or already performed. The truth about the moral good,
stated in the law of reason, is recognized practically and concretely
by the prudent judgmen t of conscience. We call that man prudent
who chooses in conformity with this judgment.
1 806

1781
Conscience enables one to assume responsibility for the acts 1 731
performed. If man commits evil, the just judgment of conscience
can remain within him as the witness to the universal truth of the
good, at the same time as the evil of his particular choice. The
verdict of the judgment of conscience remains a pledge of hope and
mercy. In attesting to the fault committed, it calls to mind the
forgiveness that must be asked, the good that must still be practiced, and the virtue that must be constantly cultivated with the
grace of God:
We shall . . . reassure our hearts before him whenever our
hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and
he knows everything.52

1782
Man has the right to act in conscience and in freedom so
as personally to make moral decisions. "He must not be forced to
act contrary to his conscience. Nor must he be prevented from
acting according to his conscience, especially in religious matters . 53

THE FoRMATION OF CoNsc iENCE

1783
Conscience must be informed and moral judgment en­
lightened. A well-formed conscience is upright and truthful. It
formulates its judgments according to reason, in conformity with
the true good willed by the wisdom of the Creator. The education
of conscience is indispensable for human beings who are subjected
to negative influences and tempted by sin to prefer their own
2039 judgment and to reject authoritative teachings.
1784
The education of the conscience is a lifelong task. From the
earliest years, it awakens the child to the knowledge and practice
of the interior law recognized by conscience. Prudent education
teaches virtue; it prevents or cures fear, selfishness and pride,
resentment arising from guilt, and feelings of complacency, born
of human weakness and faults. The education of the conscience
1 742 guarantees freedom and engenders peace of heart.
In the formation of conscience the Word of God is the light
for our path;54 we must assimilate it in faith and prayer and put it
into practice. We must also examine our conscience before the
Lord's Cross. We are assisted by the gifts of the Holy Spirit, aided
by the witness or advice of others and guided by the authoritative
890 teaching of the Church. 55

Ill.

To CHOOSE IN ACCORD WITH CONSCIENCE

1786
Faced with a moral choice, conscience can make either a
right judgment in accordance with reason and the divine law or,
on the contrary, an erroneous judgment that departs from them.
Man is sometimes confronted by situations that make
moral judgments less assured and decision difficult. But he must
always seriously seek what is right and good and discern the will
1 955 of God expressed in divine law.

1787

1788
To this purpose, man strives to interpret the data of expe­
rience and the signs of the times assisted by the virtue of prudence,
1 806 by the advice of competent people, and by the help of the Holy
Spirit and his gifts.

Some rules apply in every case:

- One may never do evil so that good may result from it;

1 756

- the Golden Rule: "Whatever you wish that men would do to you, 1 970
do so to them. "56
- charity always proceeds by way of respect for one's neighbor and 1827
his conscience: "Thus sinning against your brethren and wounding 1 971
their conscience . . . you sin against Christ. "57 Therefore "it is right
not to . . . do anything that makes your brother stumble."5 8

IV.

ERRONEOUS JUDGMENT

1790
A human being must always obey the certain judgment of
his conscience. If he were deliberately to act against it, he would
condemn himself. Yet it can happen that moral conscience remains
in ignorance and makes erroneous judgments about acts to be
performed or already committed.
1791
This ignorance can often be imputed to personal responsi­
bility. This is the case when a man "takes little trouble to find out
what is true and good, or when conscience is by degrees almost 1 704
blinded through the habit of committing sin." 59 In such cases, the
person is culpable for the evil he commits.
Ignorance of Christ and his Gospel, bad example given by 1 33
others, enslavement to one's passions, assertion of a mistaken
notion of autonomy of conscience, rejection of the Church's authority and her teaching, lack of conversion and of charity: these can
be at the source of errors of judgment in moral conduct.

1792

1793
If - on the contrary - the ignorance is invincible, or the 1 860
moral subject is not responsible for his erroneous judgment, the
evil committed by the person cannot be imputed to him. It remains
no less an evil, a privation, a disorder. One must therefore work to
correct the errors of moral conscience.
1794
A good and pure conscience is enlightened by true faith,
for charity proceeds at the same time "from a pure heart and a good
conscience and sincere faith." 60

The more a correct conscience prevails, the more do persons
and groups turn aside from blind choice and try to be guided
by objective standards of moral conduct. 61

IN BRIEF

1795

"Conscience is man's most secret core, and his sanctu­
ary. There he is alone with God whose voice echoes in
his depths" (GS 16).

1796

Conscience is a judgment of reason by which the
human person recognizes the moral quality of a con­
crete act.

1797

For the man who has committed evil, the verdict of his
conscience remains a pledge of conversion and of hope.

1798

A well-formed conscience is upright and truthful. It
formulates its judgments according to reason, in con­
formity with the true good willed by the wisdom of
the Creator. Everyone must avail himself of the means
to form his conscience.

1799

Faced with a moral choice, conscience can make either
a right judgment in accordance with reason and the
divine law or, on the contrary, an erroneous judgment
that departs from them.

1800

A human being must always obey the certain judg­
ment of his conscience.

1801

Conscience can remain in ignorance or make errone­
ous judgments. Such ignorance and errors are not
always free of guilt.

1802

The Word of God is a light for our path. We must
assimilate it in faith and prayer and put it into practice.
This is how moral conscience is formed.

THE VIRTUES

"Whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just,
1803
whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious, if there
is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about
these things . " 62
A virtue is an habitual and firm disposition to do the good. 1 733
It allows the person not only to perform good acts, but to give the
best of himself. The virtuous person tends toward the good with
all his sensory and spiritual powers; he pursues the good and 1 768
chooses it in concrete actions.
The goal of a virtuous life is to become like God. 63

I.

THE

HUMAN

VIRTUES

1804
Human virtues are firm attitudes, stable dispositions, habit­
ual perfections of intellect and will that govern our actions, order
our passions, and guide our conduct according to reason and faith .
They make possible ease, self-mastery, and joy in leading a morally 2500
good life. The virtuous man is he who freely practices the good.
The moral virtues are acquired by human effort. They are
the fruit and seed of morally good acts; they dispose all the powers 1 827
o f the human being for communion with divine love.

The cardinal virtues

1805
Four virtues play a pivotal role and accordingly are called
"cardinal"; all the others are grouped around them. They are:
prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance . "If anyone loves
righteousness, [Wisdom's] labors are virtues; for she teaches tem­
perance and prudence, justice, and courage." 64 These virtues are
praised under other names in many passages of Scripture.

62 Phi/ 4:8.

63 St. Gregory of Nyssa, De beatitudinibus, 1: PG 44, 12000.
64 Wis 8:7.

Part Three

Prudence is the virtue that disposes practical reason to
discern our true good in every circumstance and to choose the right
means of achieving it; "the prudent man looks where he is go­
ing." 65 "Keep sane and sober for your prayers. "66 Prudence is
"right reason in action," writes St. Thomas Aquinas, following
Aristotle. 67 It is not to be confused with timidity or fear, nor with
duplicity or dissimulation. It is called auriga virtutum (the chari­
oteer of the virtues); it guides the other virtues by setting rule and
measure. It is prudence that immediately guides the judgment of
conscience. The prudent man determines and directs his conduct
in accordance with this judgment. With the help of this virtue we
apply moral principles to particular cases without error and over­
come doubts about the good to achieve and the evil to avoid.

1807
Justice is the moral virtue that consists in the constant and
firm will to give their due to God and neighbor. Justice toward God
is called the "virtue of religion." Justice toward men disposes one
to respect the rights of each and to establish in human relationships
the harmony that promotes equity with regard to persons and to
the common good. The just man, often mentioned in the Sacred
Scriptures, is distinguished by habitual right thinking and the
uprightness of his conduct toward his neighbor. "You shall not be
partial to the poor or defer to the great, but in righteousness shall
you judge your neighbor." 68 "Masters, treat your slaves justly and
fairly, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven." 69

Fortitude is the moral virtue that ensures firmness in diffi­
culties and constancy in the pursuit of the good. It strengthens the
resolve to resist temptations and to overcome obstacles in the
moral life. The virtue of fortitude enables one to conquer fear, even
fear of death, and to face trials and persecutions. It disposes one
even to renounce and sacrifice his life in defense of a just cause.
"The Lord is my strength and my song." 70 "In the world you have
tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world. " 71

Temperance is the moral virtue that moderates the attrac­
tion of pleasures and provides balance in the use of created goods.
It ensures the will's mastery over instincts and keeps desires within
the limits of what is honorable. The temperate person directs the 2341
sensitive appetites toward what is good and maintains a healthy
discretion: "Do not follow your inclination and strength, walking
according to the desires of your heart." 72 Temperance is often
praised in the Old Testament: "Do not follow your base desires, 251 7
but restrain your appetites." 73 In the New Testament it is called
"moderation" or "sobriety." We ought "to live sober, upright, and
godly lives in this world ." 74
To live well is nothing other than to love God with all one's
heart, with all one's soul and with all one's efforts; from this
it comes about that love is kept whole and uncorrupted
(through temperance). No misfortune can disturb it (and this
is fortitude). It obeys only [God] (and this is justice), and is
careful in discerning things, so as not to be surprised by
deceit or trickery (and this is prudence) ?5

The virtues and grace
Human virtues acquired by education, by deliberate acts
and by a perseverance ever-renewed in repeated efforts are purified and elevated by divine grace. With God's help, they forge 1266
character and give facility in the practice of the good. The virtuous
man is happy to practice them.

1810

1811
It is not easy for man, wounded by sin, to maintain moral
balance. Christ's gift of salvation offers us the grace necessary to
persevere in the pursuit of the virtues. Everyone should always ask 2015
for this grace of light and strength, frequent the sacraments, cooperate with the Holy Spirit, and follow his calls to love what is good
and shun evil.

THE THEOLOGICAL VIRTIJE S

2086-2 094 II.
2 656-2658

1812
The human virtues are rooted in the theological virtues,
which adapt man's faculties for participation in the divine na­
ture: 76 for the theological virtues relate directly to God. They
dispose Christians to live in a relationship with the Holy Trinity.
1 2 6 6 They have the One and Triune God for their origin, motive, and
object.
1813
The theological virtues are the foundation of Christian
moral activity; they animate it and give it its special character. They
inform and give life to all the moral virtues. They are infused by
God into the souls of the faithful to make them capable of acting as
his children and of meriting eternal life. They are the pledge of the
presence and action of the Holy Spirit in the faculties of the human
2008 being. There are three theological virtues: faith, hope, and charity? 7
1 42-1 75

Faith

Faith is the theological virtue by which we believe in God
and believe all that he has said and revealed to us, and that Holy
506 Church proposes for our belief, because he is tmth itself. By faith
"man freely commits his entire self to God." 78 For this reason the
believer seeks to know and do God's will. "The righteous shall live
by faith." Living faith "work[s] through charity. " 79

1814

1815
The gift of faith remains in one who has not sinned against
it. 80 But "faith apart from works is dead": 81 when it is deprived of
hope and love, faith does not fully unite the believer to Christ and
does not make him a living member of his Body.
2471

1816
The disciple of Christ must not only keep the faith and live
on it, but also profess it, confidently bear witness to it, and spread
it: "All however must be prepared to confess Christ before men and
to follow him along the way of the Cross, amidst the persecutions
which the Church never lacks . " 82 Service of and witness to the faith

are necessary for salvation: "So every one who acknowledges me
before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in
heaven; but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before
my Father who is in heaven." 83

Hope

1817
Hope is the theological virtue by which we desire the
kingdom of heaven and eternal life as our happiness, placing our
trust in Christ's promises and relying not on our own strength, but 1 024
on the help of the grace of the Holy Spirit. "Let us hold fast the
confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is
faithful. " 84 "The Holy Spirit . . . he poured out upon us richly
through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that we might be justified by
his grace and become heirs in hope of etemal life . " 85
The virtue of hope responds to the aspiration to happiness 2 7
which God has placed in the heart of every man; i t takes u p the
hopes that inspire men's activities and purifies them so as to order
them to the Kingdom of heaven; it keeps man from discourage­
ment; it sustains him during times of abandonment; it opens up his
heart in expectation of eternal beatitude. Buoyed up by hope, he is
preserved from selfishness and led to the happiness that flows
from charity.

1818

Christian hope takes up and fulfills the hope of the chosen
people which has its origin and model in the hope of Abraham, who
was blessed abundantly by the promises of God fulfilled in Isaac,
and who was purified by the test of the sacrifice. 86 "Hoping against 1 46
hope, he believed, and thus became the father of many nations. " 87

Part Three

448

'
Christian hope unfolds from the beginning of Jesus'
preaching in the proclamation of the beatitudes. The beatitudes raise
1 71 6 our hope toward heaven as the new Promised Land; they trace the
path that leads through the trials that await the disciples of Jesus.
But through the merits of Jesus Christ and of his Passion, God keeps
us in the "hope that does not disappoint." 88 Hope is the "sure and
steadfast anchor of the soul . . . that enters . . . where Jesus has gone
as a forerunner on our behal£. " 89 Hope is also a weapon that
protects us in the struggle of salvation: "Let us . . . put on the
breastplate of faith and charity, and for a helmet the hope of
salvation." 90 It affords us joy even under trial: "Rejoice in your
hope, be patient in tribulation." 9 1 Hope is expressed and nourished
2772 in prayer, especially in the Our Father, the summ ary of everything
that hope leads us to desire.

1820

1821
We can therefore hope in the glory of heaven promised by
God to those who love him and do his will. 92 In every circumstance,
each one of us should hope, with the grace of God, to persevere "to
201 6 the end" 93 and to obtain the joy of heaven, as God's eternal reward
1 037 for the good works accomplished with the grace of Christ. In hope,
the Church prays for "all men to be saved. "94 She longs to be united
with Christ, her Bridegroom, in the glory of heaven:
Hope, 0 my soul, hope. You know neither the day nor the
hour. Watch carefully, for everything passes quickly, even
though your impatience makes doubtful what is certain, and
turns a very short time into a long one. Dream that the more
you struggle, the more you prove the love that you bear your
God, and the more you will rejoice one day with your
Beloved, in a happiness and rapture that can never end. 95

Charity
Charity is the theological virtue by which we love God
above all things for his own sake, and our neighbor as ourselves
for the love of God.

Jesus makes charity the new commandment. 96 By loving his 1 9 70
own "to the end," 97 he makes manifest the Father's love which he
receives. By loving one another, the disciples imitate the love of
Jesus which they themselves receive. Whence Jesus says: "As the
Father has loved me, so have I loved you; abide in my love." And
again: "This is my commandment, that you love one another as I
have loved you." 98

1823

1824
Fruit of the Spirit and fullness of the Law, charity keeps 735
the commandments of God and his Christ: "Abide in my love. If you
keep my commandments, you will abide in my love. " 99
1825
Christ died out of love for us, while we were still "ene- 604
mies. " 100 The Lord asks us to love as he does, even our enemies, to
make ourselves the neighbor of those farthest away, and to love
children and the poor as Christ himseif. l01
The Apostle Paul has given an incomparable depiction of
charity: "charity is patient and kind, charity is not jealous or
boastful; it is not arrogant or rude. Charity does not insist on
i ts own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice
at wrong, but rejoices in the right. Charity bears all thin�,
believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things." 1

1826
"If I . . . have not charity," says the Apostle, "I am nothing."
Whatever my privilege, service, or even virtue, "if I . . . have not
charity, I gain nothing. " 103 Charity is superior to all the virtues. It
is the first of the theological virtues: "So faith, hope, charity abide,
these three. But the greatest of these is charity." 104
The practice of all the virtues is animated and inspired by
charity, which "binds everything together in perfect harmony" ; 105
it is the form of the virtues; it articulates and orders them among 8 1 5
themselves; it is the source and the goal of their Christian practice. 826
Charity upholds and purifies our human ability to love, and raises
it to the supernatural perfection of divine love.

The practice of the moral life animated by charity gives to
the Christian the spiritual freedom of the children of God. He no
1 972 longer stands before God as a slave, in servile fear, or as a merce­
nary looking for wages, but as a son responding to the love of him
who "first loved us" : 106

1828

If we turn away from evil out of fear of punishment, we are
in the posi tion of slaves. If we pursue the enticement of
wages, . . . we resemble mercenaries. Finally if we obey for
the sake of the good itself and out of love for him who
commands . . . we are in the position of children J 07

1829
The fruits of charity are joy, peace, and mercy; charity
demands beneficence and fraternal correction; it is benevolence; it
2540 fosters reciprocity and remains disinterested and generous; it is
friendship and communion:
Love is itself the fulfillment of all our works . There is the goal;
that is why we run: we run toward it, and once we reach it,
in it we shall find rest. 108

III.

THE GIFfS AND FRUITS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT

The moral life of Christians is sustained by the gifts of the
Holy Spirit. These are permanent dispositions which make man
docile in following the promptings of the Holy Spirit.

1830

The seven gifts of the Holy Spirit are wisdom, under­
standing, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the
Lord. They belong in their fullness to Christ, Son of David. 109 They
1 266, 1 299 complete and perfect the virtues of those who receive them. They
make the faithful docile in readily obeying divine inspirations.

1831

Let your good spirit lead me on a level path. 110
For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God . . .
If children, then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with
Christ. 1 1 1

The fruits of the Spirit are perfections that the Holy Spirit 736
forms in us as the first fruits of eternal glory. The tradition of the
Church lists twelve of them: "charity, joy, peace, patience, kind­
ness, goodness, generosity, gentleness, faithfulness, modesty, self­
control, chastity. " 112

IN BRIEF

1833

Virtue is a habitual and firm disposition to do good.

1834

The human virtues are stable dispositions of the intel­
lect and the will that govern our acts, order our pas­
sions, and guide our conduct in accordance with
reason and faith. They can be grouped around the four
cardinal virtues: prudence, justice, fortitude, and tem­
perance.

1835

Prudence disposes the practical reason to discern, in
every circumstance, our true good and to choose the
right means for achieving it.

1836

Justice consists in the firm and constant will to give
God and neighbor their due.

1837

Fortitude ensures firmness in difficulties and con­
stancy in the pursuit of the good.

1838

Temperance moderates the attraction of the pleasures
of the senses and provides balance in the use of created
goods.

1839

The moral virtues grow through education, deliberate
acts, and perseverance in struggle. Divine grace puri­
fies and elevates them.

1840

The theological virtues dispose Christians to live in a
relationship with the Holy Trinity. They have God for
their origin, their motive, and their object - God
known by faith, God hoped in and loved for his own
sake.

1841

There are three theological virtues: faith, hope, and
charity. They inform all the moral virtues and give life
to them.

112 Gal 5:22-23 (Vulg.).

Part Three

452
1842

By faith, we believe in God and believe all that he has
revealed to us and that Holy Church proposes for our
belief.

1843

By hope we desire, and with steadfast trust await from
God, eternal life and the graces to merit it.

1844

By charity, we love God above all things and our
neighbor as ourselves for love of God. Charity, the
form of all the virtues, "binds everything together in
perfect harmony" (Col 3:14).

1845

The seven gifts of the Holy Spirit bestowed upon
Christians are wisdom, understanding, counsel, forti­
tude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord.

MERCY AND SIN

1846
The Gospel is the revelation in Jesus Christ of God's mercy
to sinn e rs. 1 13 The angel announced to Joseph: "You shall call his
name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins." 1 14 The same
1 365 is true of the Eucharist, the sacrament of redemption: "This is my
blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the
forgiveness of sins . " 115
430

387, 1 455

"God created us without us: but he did not will to save us
without us." 1 16 To receive his mercy, we must admit our faults. "If
we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not
in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, and will forgive
our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." 117

1847

As St. Paul affirms, "Where sin increased, grace abounded
all the more." 1 18 But to do its work grace must uncover sin so as to
385 convert our hearts and bestow on us "righteousness to eternal life

through Jesus Christ our Lord." 11 9 Like a physician who probes the
wound before treating it, God, by his Word and by his Spirit, casts
a living light on sin:
Conversion req uires convincing of sin; it includes the interior
judgment of conscience, and this, being a proof of the action
of the Spirit of truth in man's inmost being, becomes at the
same time the start of a new grant of grace and love: "Receive
the Holy Spirit. " Thus in this "convincing concerning sin"
we discover a double gift: the gift of the truth of conscience
and the gift of the certainty of redemption. The Spirit of truth
l
is the Consoler. 20

1 433

THE DEFINITION OF SIN

1849
Sin is an offense against reason, truth, and right con- 3 1 1
science; it is failure in genuine love for God and neighbor caused
by a perverse attachment to certain goods. It wounds the nature of
man and inj ures human solidarity. It has been defined as "an
utterance, a deed, or a desire contrary to the eternal law." 121
1 952
1850
Sin is an offense against God: "Against you, you alone, 1 440
have I sinned, and done that which is evil in your sight." 122 Sin sets
itself against God's love for us and turns our hearts away from it.
Like the first sin, it is disobedience, a revolt against God through 397
the will to become "like gods," 123 knowing and determining good
and evil. Sin is thus "love of oneself even to contempt of God. " 124
In this proud self-exaltation, sin is diametrically opposed to the
615
obedience of Jesus, which achieves our salvation. 125
It is precisely in the Passion, when the mercy of Christ is
about to vanquish it, that sin most clearly manifests its violence and
its many forms: unbelief, murderous hatred, shunning and mockery by the leaders and the people, Pilate's cowardice and the
cruelty of the soldiers, Judas' betrayal - so bitter to Jesus, Peter's 598
denial and the disciples' flight. However, at the very hour of

III.

THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF SINS

1852
There are a great many kinds of sins. Scripture provides
several lists of them . The Letter to the Galatians contrasts the works
of the flesh with the fruit of the Spirit: "Now the works of the flesh
are plain: fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery,
enmity, strife, jealousy, anger, selfishness, dissension, factions,
envy, drunkenness, carousing, and the like . I warn you, as I warned
you before, that those who do such things shall not inherit the
Kingdom of God. 1 27
"

1853
Sins can be distinguished according to their objects, as can every
human act; or according to the virtues they oppose, by excess or defect; or
according to the commandments they violate. They can also be classed
according to whether they concern God, neighbor, or oneself; they can be
2067 divided into spiritual and carnal sins, or again as sins in thought, word,
deed, or omission. The root of sin is in the heart of man, in his free will,
according to the teaching of the Lord: "For out of the heart come evil
368 thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander. These
28
are what defile a man." 1
But in the heart also resides charity, the source
of the good and pure works, which sin wounds.
1 751

IV.

THE GRAVITY OF SIN: MORTAL AND VENIAL SIN

1854
Sins are rightly evaluated according to their gravity. The
distinction between mortal and venial sin, already evident in Scrip­
ture, 1 29 became part of the tradition of the Church. It is corrobo­
rated by human experience.
1 395

1 446

1855
Mortal sin destroys charity in the heart of man by a grave
violation of God's law; it turns man away from God, who is his
ultimate end and his beatitude, by preferring an inferior good to
him .
Venial sin allows charity to subsist, even though it offends
and wounds it.
1856
Mortal sin, by attacking the vital principle within us - that
is, charity - necessitates a new initiative of God's mercy and a

conversion of heart which is normally accomplished within the
setting of the sacrament of reconciliation:
When the will sets itself upon something that is of its nature
incompatible with the charity that orients man toward his
ultimate end, then the sin is mortal by its very object . . .
whether it contradicts the love of God, such as blasphemy or
perjury, or the love of neighbor, such as homicide or adul­
tery. . . . But when the sinner's will is set upon something
that of i ts nature involves a disorder, but is not opposed to
the love of God and neighbor, such as thoughtless chatter or
immoderate laughter and the like, such sins are venia!. 130

1857
For a sin to be mortal, three conditions must together be
met: "Mortal sin is sin whose object is grave matter and which is
also committed with full knowledge and deliberate consent." 131
1858

Grave matter is specified by the Ten Commandments, cor-

2072

responding to the answer of Jesus to the rich young man: "Do not
kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false
witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and your mother. " 132
The gravity of sins is more or less great: murder is graver than theft.
One must also take into account who is wronged: violence against
2214
parents is in itself graver than violence against a stranger.

1859
Mortal sin requires full knowledge and complete consent. It 1 734
presupposes knowledge of the sinful character of the act, of its
opposition to God's law. It also implies a consent sufficiently
deliberate to be a personal choice. Feigned ignorance and hardness
of heart 133 do not diminish, but rather increase, the voluntary
character of a sin.
1860
Unintentional ignorance can diminish or even remove the 1 735
imputability of a grave offense. But no one is deemed to be ignorant
of the principles of the moral law, which are written in the con­
science of every man. The promptings of feelings and passions can
also diminish the voluntary and free character of the offense, as can 1 767
external pressures or p athological disorders . Sin committed
through malice, by deliberate choice of evil, is the gravest.

Part Three

1 742 1861
Mortal sin is a radical po�sibility of human freedom, as is
love itself. It results in the loss of charity and the privation of
sanctifying grace, that is, of the state of grace. If it is not redeemed
by repentance and God's forgiveness, it causes exclusion from
Christ's kingdom and the eternal death of hell, for our freedom has
1 033 the power to make choices for ever, with no turning back. How­
ever, although we can judge that an act is in itself a grave offense,
we must entrust judgment of persons to the justice and mercy of
God.
1862
One commits venial sin when, in a less serious matter, he
does not observe the standard prescribed by the moral law, or
when he disobeys the moral law in a grave matter, but without full
knowledge or without complete consent.
1394 1863
Venial sin weakens charity; it manifests a disordered affection for created goods; it impedes the soul's progress in the exercise
of the virtues and the practice of the moral good; it merits temporal
punishment. Deliberate and unrepented venial sin disposes us
1472 little by little to commit mortal sin. However venial sin does not
break the covenant with God. With God's grace it is humanly
reparable. "Venial sin does not deprive the sinner of sanctifying
grace, friendship with God, charity, and consequently eternal hap­
piness." 134
While he is in the flesh, man cannot help but have at least
some light sins. But do not despise these sins which we call
"light" : if you take them for light when you weigh them,
tremble when you count them. A number of light objects
makes a great mass; a number of drops fills a river; a number
of grains makes a heap. What then is our hope? Above all,
confession . . . 135
.

1864
"Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be
forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be
forgiven." 136 There are no limits to the mercy of God, but anyone
2091 who deliberately refuses to accept his mercy by repenting, rejects
the forgiveness of his sins and the salvation offered by the Holy
1 037 Spirit.l3 7 Such hardness of heart can lead to final impenitence and
eternal loss.

THE PROLIFERATION OF SIN

1865
Sin creates a proclivity to sin; it engenders vice by repetition of the same acts. This results in perverse inclinations which
cloud conscience and corrupt the concrete judgment of good and
evil. Thus sin tends to reproduce itself and reinforce itself, but it
cannot destroy the moral sense at its root.

401

1 768

1866
Vices can be classified according to the virtues they op­
pose, or also be linked to the capital sins which Christian experience
has distinguished, following St. John Cassian and St. Gregory the
Great. They are called "capital" because they engender other sins,
other vices. 1 38 They are pride, avarice, envy, wrath, lust, gluttony,
2539
and sloth or acedia.
1867 The catechetical tradition also recalls that there are "sins
that cry to heaven " : the blood of Abel, 139 the sin of the Sodomites,140
the cry of the people oppressed in Egypt, 141 the cry of the foreigner,
the widow, and the orphan, 142 injustice to the wage eamer. 1 43
1868
Sin is a personal act. Moreover, we have a responsibility
for the sins committed by others when we cooperate in them:

2268

1 73 6

- by participating directly and voluntarily in them;
- by ordering, advising, praising, or approving them;
- by not disclosing or not hindering them when we have an
obligation to do so;
- by protecting evil-doers.

1869
Thus sin makes men accomplices of one another and
causes concupiscence, violence, and injustice to reign among them.
Sins give rise to social situations and institutions that are contrary
to the divine goodness. "Structures of sin" are the expression and
effect of personal sins. They lead their victims to do evil in their
tum. In an analogous sense, they constitute a "social sin." 1 44

"God has consigned all men to disobedience, that he
may have mercy upon all" (Rom 1 1 :32).

1871

Sin is an utterance, a deed, or a desire contrary to the
eternal law (St. Augustine, Faust 22: PL 42, 418). It is
an offense against God. It rises up against God in a
disobedience contrary to the obedience of Christ.

1872

Sin is an act contrary to reason. It wounds man's
nature and injures human solidarity.

1873

The root of all sins lies in man's heart. The kinds and
the gravity of sins are determined principally by their
objects.

1874

To choose deliberately - that is, both knowing it and
willing it - something gravely contrary to the divine
law and to the ultimate end of man is to commit a
mortal sin. This destroys in us the charity without
which eternal beatitude is impossible. Unrepented, it
brings eternal death.

1875

Venial sin constitutes a moral disorder that is repara­
ble by charity, which it allows to subsist in us.

1876

The repetition of sins - even venial ones - engenders
vices, among which are the capital sins.

THE HUMAN COMMUNITY
C HAPTER

1877 The vocation of humanity is to show forth the image of
God and to be transformed into the image of the Father's only Son.
This vocation takes a personal form since each of us is called to
enter into the divine beatitude; it also concerns the human community as a whole.

OF THE HUMAN VOCATION

1878
All men are called to the same end: God himself. There is
a certain resemblance between the unity of the divine persons and 1 702
the fraternity that men are to establish among themselves in truth
and love. 1 Love of neighbor is inseparable from love for God.
1879 The human person needs to live in society. Society is not
for him an extraneous addition but a requirement of his nature.
Through the exchange with others, mutual service and dialogue
with his brethren, man develops his potential; he thus responds to
his vocation. 2

1 936

1880
A society is a group of persons bound together organically 771
by a principle of unity that goes beyond each one of them. As an
assembly that is at once visible and spirituat a society endures
through time: it gathers up the past and prepares for the future. By
means of society, each man is established as an "heir" and receives
certain "talents" that enrich his identity and whose fruits he must
develop.3 He rightly owes loyalty to the communities of which he
is part and respect to those in authority who have charge of the
common good.

Each community is defined by its purpose and conse­
quently obeys specific rules; but "the human person . . . is and ought
to be the principle, the subject and the end of all social institu­
tions." 4
1882
Certain societies, such as the family and the state, corre­
spond more directly to the nature of man; they are necessary to
him. To promote the participation of the greatest number in the life
of a society, the creation of voluntary associations and institutions
must be encouraged "on both national and international levels,
which relate to economic and social goals, to cultural and recrea­
tional activities, to sport, to various professions, and to political
affairs." 5 This " socialization " also expresses the natural tendency for
human beings to associate with one another for the sake of attain­
ing objectives that exceed individual capacities. It develops the
qualities of the person, especially the sense of initiative and respon­
sibility, and helps guarantee his rights. 6
1883
Socialization also presents dangers. Excessive intervention
by the state can threaten personal freedom and initiative. The
teaching of the Church has elaborated the principle of subsidiarity,
according to which "a community of a higher order should not
interfere in the internal life of a community of a lower order,
depriving the latter of its functions, but rather should support it in
case of need and help to co-ordinate its activity with the activities
of the rest of society, always with a view to the common good."7
1884
God has not willed to reserve to himself all exercise of
power. He entrusts to every creature the functions it is capable of
performing, according to the capacities of its own nature. This
mode of governance ought to be followed in social life. The way
God acts in governing the world, which bears witness to such great
regard for human freedom, should inspire the wisdom of those
who govern human communities. They should behave as ministers
of divine providence.
1885
The principle of subsidiarity is opposed to all forms of
collectivism. It sets limits for state intervention. It aims at harmo­
nizing the relationships between individuals and societies. It tends
toward the establishment of true international order.

CONVERSION AND SOCIETY

1886
Society is essential to the fulfillment of the human vocation. To attain this aim, respect must be accorded to the just
hierarchy of values, which "subordinates physical and instinctual
dimensions to interior and spiritual ones:"S
Human society must primarily be considered something
pertaining to the spiritual. Through it, in the bright light of
truth, men should share their knowledge, be able to exercise
their rights and fulfill their obligations, be inspired to seek
spiritual values; mutually derive genuine pleasure from the
beautiful, of whatever order it be; always be readily disposed
to pass on to others the best of their own cultural heritage;
and eagerly strive to make their own the spiritual achievements of others. These benefits not only influence, but at the
same time give aim and scope to all that has bearing on
cultural expressions, economic, and social institutions, political movements and forms, laws, and all other structures
by which society is outwardly established and constantly
developed. 9

1887
The inversion of means and ends, 10 which results in giving
the value of ultimate end to what is only a means for attaining it,
or in viewing persons as mere means to that end, engenders unjust
structures which "make Christian conduct in keeping with the
commandments of the divine Law-giver difficult and almost impossible." 1 1
1888
It is necessary, then, to appeal to the spiritual and moral
capacities of the human person and to the permanent need for his
inner conversion, so as to obtain social changes that will really serve
him. The acknowledged priority of the conversion of heart in no
way eliminates but on the contrary imposes the obligation of
bringing the appropriate remedies to institutions and living con­
ditions when they are an inducement to sin, so that they conform
to the norms of justice and advance the good rather than hinder
it. 12

Without the help of grace, men would not know how "to

discern the often narrow path between the cowardice which gives
in to evil, and the violence which under the illusion of fighting evil
only ma kes it worse." 13 This is the path of charity, that is, of the
love of God and of neighbor. Charity is the greatest social com­
mandment. It respects others and their rights. It requires the prac­
tice of justice, and it alone makes us capable of it. Charity inspires
a life of self-giving: "Whoever seeks to gain his life will lose it, but
whoever loses his life will preserve it." 1 4

1890

There is a certain resemblance between the unity of the
divine persons and the fraternity that men ought to

The human person needs life in society in order to

the subject, and the object of every social organization"

Widespread participation in voluntary associations
and institutions is to be encouraged.

1894

In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, nei­
ther the state nor any larger society should substitute
itself for the initiative and responsibility of individuals
and intermediary bodies.

1895

Society ought to promote the exercise of virtue, not
obstruct it. It should be animated by a just hierarchy
of values .

1896

Where sin has perverted the social climate, it is neces­
sary to call for the conversion of hearts and appeal to
the grace of God. Charity urges just reforms. There is
no solution to the social question apart from the Gos­
pel (cf. CA 3, 5).

AUTHORITY

1897
"Human society can be neither well-ordered nor prosperous unless it has some people invested with legitimate authority to
preserve its institutions and to devote themselves as far as is
necessary to work and care for the good of all." 15
By "authority" one means the quality by virtue of which
persons or institutions make laws and give orders to men and
expect obedience from them.

2234

1898
Every human community needs an authority to govern
it. 1 6 The foundation of such authority lies in human nature. It is
necessary for the unity of the state. Its role is to ensure as far as
possible the common good of the society.
1899
The authority required by the moral order derives from
God: "Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For
there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have
been instituted by God. Therefore he who resists the authorities
resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur
judgment." 1 7

2235

1900
The duty of obedience requires all to give due honor to
authority and to treat those who are charged to exercise it with
respect, and, insofar as it is deserved, with gratitude and good-will.

2238

Pope St. Clement of Rome provides the Church's most ancient prayer for political authorities: 18 "Grant to them, Lord,
health, peace, concord, and stability, so that they may exercise without offense the sovereignty that you have given
them. Master, heavenly King of the ages, you give glory,
honor, and power over the things of earth to the sons of men.
Direct, Lord, their counsel, following what is pleasing and
acceptable in your sight, so that by exercising with devotion
and in peace and gentleness the power that you have given
to them, they may find favor with you." 19

If authority belongs to the order established by God, "the
choice of the political regime and the appointment of rulers are left
to the free decision of the citizens. "20

2242

1 930

The diversity of political regimes is morally acceptable,
provided they serve the legitimate good of the communities that
adopt them. Regimes whose nature is contrary to the natural law,
to the public order, and to the fundamental rights of persons cannot
achieve the common good of the nations on which they have been
imposed.

1902
Authority does not derive its moral legitimacy from itself.
It must not behave in a despotic manner, but must act for the
common good as a "moral force based on freedom and a sense of
responsibility" : 21

1 951

2242

A human law has the character of law to the extent that it
accords with right reason, and thus derives from the eternal
law. Insofar as it falls short of right reason it is said to be an
unjust law, and thus has not so much the nature of law as of
a kind of violence. 22

1903
Authority is exercised legitimately only when it seeks the
common good of the group concerned and if it employs morally
licit means to attain it. If rulers were to enact unjust laws or take
measures contrary to the moral order, such arrangements would
not be binding in conscience. In such a case, "authority breaks
down completely and results in shameful abuse." 23
1904
"It is preferable that each power be balanced by other
powers and by other spheres of responsibility which keep it within
proper bounds. This is the principle of the 'rule of law,' in which
the law is sovereign and not the arbitrary will of men." 24

Do not live entirely isolated, having retreated into your­
selves, as if you were already justified, but gather instead to
seek the common good together.25

1906
By common good is to be understood "the sum total of
social conditions which allow people, either as groups or as indi­
viduals, to reach their fulfillment more fully and more easily." 26
The common good concerns the life of all. It calls for prudence from
each, and even more from those who exercise the office of author­
ity. It consists of three essential elements:
1907
First, the common good presupposes respect for the person
as such. In the name of the common good, public authorities are
bound to respect the fundamental and inalienable rights of the
human person. Society should permit each of its members to fulfill
his vocation. In particular, the common good resides in the conditions for the exercise of the natural freedoms indispensable for the
development of the human vocation, such as "the right to act
according to a sound norm of conscience and to safeguard .
privacy, and rightful freedom also in matters of religion." 27
.

.

1908
Second, the common good requires the social well-being and
development of the group itself. Development is the epitome of all
social duties. Certainly, it is the proper function of authority to
arbitrate, in the name of the common good, between various
particular interests; but it should make accessible to each what is
needed to lead a truly human life: food, clothing, health, work,
education and culture, suitable information, the right to establish
a family, and so on.28
1909 Finally, the common good requires peace, that is, the stability and security of a just order. It presupposes that authority should
ensure by morally acceptable means the security of society and its
members. It is the basis of the right to legitimate personal and
collective defence.
1910
Each human community possesses a common good which
permits it to be recognized as such; it is in the political community
that its most complete realization is found. It is the role of the state
to defend and promote the common good of civil society, its
citizens, and intermediate bodies.

Human interdependence is increasing and gradually
spreading throughout the world. The unity of the human family,
embracing people who enjoy equal natural dignity, implies a uni­
versal common good. This good calls for an organization of the
community of nations able to "provide for the different needs of
men; this will involve the sphere of social life to which belong
questions of food, hygiene, education, . . . and certain situations
arising here and there, as for example . . . alleviating the miseries
of refugees dispersed throughout the world, and assisting mi­
grants and their families."29
1912
The common good is always oriented towards the pro­
gress of persons: "The order of things must be subordinate to the
order of persons, and not the other way around."30 This order is
founded on truth, built up in justice, and animated by love.

III.

RESPONSIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION

"Participation" is the voluntary and generous engagement
1913
of a person in social interchange. It is necessary that all participate,
each according to his position and role, in promoting the common
good. This obligation is inherent in the dignity of the human
person.

1 734

2239

1914
Participation is achieved first of all by taking charge of the
areas for which one assumes personal responsibility: by the care
taken for the education of his family, by conscientious work, and
so forth, man participates in the good of others and of society. 31
1915
As far as possible citizens should take an active part in
public life. The manner of this participation may vary from one
country or culture to another. "One must pay tribute to those
nations whose systems permit the largest possible number of the
citizens to take part in public life in a climate of genuine free­
dom." 32

As with any ethical obligation, the participation of all in
realizing the common good calls for a continually renewed conversion of the social partners. Fraud and other subterfuges, by which
some people evade the constraints of the law and the prescriptions
of societal obligation, must be firmly condemned because they are
incompatible with the requirements of justice. Much care should
be taken to promote institutions that improve the conditions of
human life. 33
1917
It is incumbent on those who exercise authority to
strengthen the values that inspire the confidence of the members
of the group and encourage them to put themselves at the service
of others. Participation begins with education and culture. "One is
entitled to think that the future of humanity is in the hands of those
who are capable of providing the generations to come with reasons
for life and optimism. "34

IN BRIEF

"There is no authority except from God, and those
authorities that exist have been instituted by God"
(Rom 13:1).

1919

Every human community needs an authority in order
to endure and develop.

1920

"The political community and public authority are
based on human nature and therefore . . . belong to an
order established by God" (GS 74 § 3).

1921

Authority is exercised legitimately if it is committed to
the common good of society. To attain this it must
employ morally acceptable means.

1922

The diversity of political regimes is legitimate, pro­
vided they contribute to the good of the community.

1923

Political authority must be exercised within the limits
of the moral order and must guarantee the conditions
for the exercise of freedom.

The conunon good comprises "the sum total of social
conditions which allow people, either as groups or as
individuals, to reach their fulfillment more fully and
more easily" (GS 26 § 1).

1925

The common good consists of three essential elements:
respect for and promotion of the fundamental rights
of the person; prosperity, or the development of the
spiritual and temporal goods of society; the peace and
security of the group and of its members.

1926

The dignity of the human person requires the pursuit
of the conunon good. Everyone should be concerned
to create and support institutions that improve the
conditions of human life.

1927

It is the role of the state to defend and promote the
conunon good of civil society. The conunon good of
the whole human family calls for an organization of
society on the international level.

SOCIAL JUSTICE

2832

1928
Society ensures social justice when it provides the condi­
tions that allow associations or individuals to obtain what is their
due, according to their nature and their vocation. Social justice is
linked to the common good and the exercise of authority.

RESPECT FOR TH E HUMAN PERSON

1929
Social justice can be obtained only in respecting the transcendent dignity of man. The person represents the ultimate end
of society, which is ordered to him:
What is at stake is the dignity of the human person, whose
defense and promotion have been entrusted to us by the
Creator, and to whom the men and women at every moment
of history are strictly and responsibly in debt.35

35 John Paul II, SRS 47.

Life in Christ

469

1930
Respect for the human person entails respect for the rights
that flow from his dignity as a creature. These rights are prior to
society and must be recognized by it. They are the basis of the moral
legitimacy of every authority: by flouting them, or refusing to
recognize them in its positive legislation, a society undermines its
own moral legitimacy. 36 If it does not respect them, authority can
rely only on force or violence to obtain obedience from its subjects.
It is the Church's role to remind men of good will of these rights
and to distinguish them from unwarranted or false claims.
1931
Respect for the human person proceeds by way of respect
for the principle that "everyone should look upon his neighbor
(without any exception) as 'another self,' above all bearing in mind
his life and the means necessary for living it with dignity."37 No
legislation could by itself do away with the fears, prejudices, and
attitudes of pride and selfishness which obstruct the establishment
of truly fraternal societies. Such behavior will cease only through
the charity that finds in every man a "neighbor," a brother.
1932
The duty of making oneself a neighbor to others and
actively serving them becomes even more urgent when it involves
the disadvantaged, in whatever area this may be. "As you did it to
one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me." 38
1933
This same duty extends to those who think or act differently from us. The teaching of Christ goes so far as to require the
forgiveness of offenses. He extends the commandment of love,
which is that of the New Law, to all enemies. 39 Liberation in the
spirit of the Gospel is incompatible with hatred of one's enemy as
a person, but not with hatred of the evil that he does as an enemy.

EQUALITY AND DIFFERENCES AMONG MEN

1934
Created in the image of the one God and equally endowed
with rational souls, all men have the same nature and the same
origin. Redeemed by the sacrifice of Christ, all are called to participate in the same divine beatitude: all therefore enjoy an equal
dignity.

1935
The equality of men rests essentially on their dignity as
persons and the rights that flow from it:
Every form of social or cultural discrimination in fundamen­
tal personal rights on the grounds of sex, race, color, social
conditions, language, or religion must be curbed and eradi­
4
cated as incompatible with God's design. 0

1 879

1936
On coming into the world, man is not equipped with
everything he needs for developing his bodily and spiritual life. He
needs others. Differences appear tied to age, physical abilities,
intellectual or moral aptitudes, the benefits derived from social
commerce, and the distribution of wealth. 41 The "talents" are not
distributed equally. 42

340

1937
These differences belong to God's plan, who wills that
each receive what he needs from others, and that those endowed
with particular "talents" share the benefits with those who need
them. These differences encourage and often oblige persons to
practice generosity, kindness, and sharing of goods; they foster the
mutual enrichment of cultures:

791
1 202

I distribute the virtues quite diversely; I do not give all of
them to each person, but some to one, some to others . . . I
shall give principally charity to one; justice to another; hu­
mility to this one, a living faith to that one . . . . And so I have
given many gifts and graces, both spiritual and temporal,
with such diversity that I have not given everything to one
single person, so that you may be constrained to practice
charity towards one another . . I have willed that one should
need another and that all should be my ministers in distrib­
uting the graces and gifts they have received from me. 43

1938
There exist also sinful inequalities that affect millions of men
and women. These are in open contradiction of the Gospel:
Their equal dignity as persons demands that we strive for
fairer and more humane conditions. Excessive economic and
social disparity between individuals and peoples of the one
human race is a source of scandal and militates against social
justice, equi
human dignity, as well as social and interna­
tional peace.

HUMAN SOLIDARITY

1939
The principle of solidarity, also articulated in terms of
"friendship" or "social charity," is a direct demand of human and
Christian brotherhood. 45
An error, "today abundantly widespread, is disregard for
the law of human solidarity and charity, dictated and imposed both by our common origin and by the equality in
rational nature of all men, whatever nation they belong to.
This law is sealed by the sacrifice of redemption offered by
Jesus Christ on the altar of the Cross to his heavenly Father,
on behalf of sinful humanity." 46

2213

360

1940
Solidarity is manifested in the first place by the distribution of goods and remuneration for work. It also presupposes the
effort for a more just social order where tensions are better able to
be reduced and conflicts more readily settled by negotiation.

2402

1941
Socio-economic problems can be resolved only with the
help of all the forms of solidarity: solidarity of the poor among
themselves, between rich and poor, of workers among themselves,
between employers and employees in a business, solidarity among
nations and peoples. International solidarity is a requirement of the
moral order; world peace depends in part upon this.

231 7

1942
The virtue of solidarity goes beyond material goods. In
spreading the spiritual goods of the faith, the Church has pro­
moted, and often opened new paths for, the development of ternporal goods as well. And so throughout the centuries has the Lord's
saying been verified: "Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well": 47
For two thousand years this sentiment has lived and endured in the soul of the Church, impelling souls then and
now to the heroic charity of monastic farmers, liberators of
slaves, healers of the sick, and messengers of faith, civilization, and science to all generations and all peoples for the
sake of creating the social conditions capable of offering to
everyone possible a life worthy of man and of a Christian. 48

CHAPTER

G OD'S SALVATION:

THREE
L AW AND G RACE

1949
Called to beatitude but wounded by sin, man stands in
need of salvation from God. Divine help comes to him in Christ
through the law that guides him and the grace that sustains him:
Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for
God is at work in you, both to will and to work for his good
pleasure. 1

ARTICLE 1
THE MORAL LAW

1950
The moral law is the work of divine Wisdom. Its biblical
meaning can be defined as fatherly instruction, God's pedagogy.
It prescribes for man the ways, the rules of conduct that lead to the
promised beatitude; it proscribes the ways of evil which tum him
away from God and his love. It is at once firm in its precepts and,
in its promises, worthy of love.
1951
Law is a rule of conduct enacted by competent authority
for the sake of the common good. The moral law presupposes the
rational order, established among creatures for their good and to
serve their final end, by the power, wisdom, and goodness of the
Creator. All law finds its first and ultimate truth in the eternal law.
Law is declared and established by reason as a participation in the
providence of the living God, Creator and Redeemer of all. "Such
an ordinance of reason is what one calls law."2
Alone among all animate beings, man can boast of having
been counted worthy to receive a law from God: as an animal
endowed with reason, capable of understanding and dis­
cernment, he is to govern his conduct by using his freedom
and reason, in obedience to the One who has entrusted
everything to him.3

There are different expressions of the moral law, all of
them interrelated: eternal law - the source, in God, of all law;
natural law; revealed law, comprising the Old Law and the New
Law, or Law of the Gospel; finally, civil and ecclesiastical laws.
578

1953
The moral law finds its fullness and its unity in Christ. Jesus
Christ is in person the way of perfection. He is the end of the law, for
only he teaches and bestows the justice of God: "For Christ is the end
of the law, that every one who has faith may be justified."4

T H E NATURAL MORAL LAW

I.

307
1 776

1954
Man participates in the wisdom and goodness of the Crea­
tor who gives him mastery over his acts and the ability to govern
himself with a view to the true and the good. The natural law
expresses the original moral sense which enables man to discern
by reason the good and the evil, the truth and the lie:
The natural law is written and engraved in the soul of each
and every man, because it is human reason ordaining him
to do good and forbidding him to sin . . . But this command
of human reason would not have the force of law if it were
not the voice and interpreter of a higher reason to which our
spirit and our freedom must be submitted.5

1 787

1955
The "divine and natural" law6 shows man the way to
follow so as to practice the good and attain his end. The natural
law states the first and essential precepts which govern the moral
life. It hinges upon the desire for God and submission to him, who
is the source and judge of all that is good, as well as upon the sense
that the other is one's equal. Its principal precepts are expressed in
the Decalogue. This law is called "natural," not in reference to the
nature of irrational beings, but because reason which decrees it
properly belongs to human nature:
Where then are these rules written, if not in the book of that
light we call the truth? In it is written every just law; from it
the law passes into the heart of the man who does justice, not
that it migrates into it, but that it places its imprint on i t, like
a seal on a ring that passes onto wax, without leaving the
ring ?

The natural law is nothing other than the light of under­
standing placed in us by God; through it we know what we
must do and what we must avoid . God has given this light
or law at the creation. 8

1956
The natural law, present in the heart of each man and
established by reason, is universal in its precepts and its authority
extends to all men. It expresses the dignity of the person and
determines the basis for his fundamental rights and duties:

2261

For there is a true law: right reason. It is in conformity with
nature, is diffused among all men, and is immutable and
eternal; its orders summon to duty; its prohibitions turn
away from offense . . . . To replace it with a contrary law is a
sacrilege; failure to apply even one of its provisions is for­
bidden; no one can abrogate it entirely. 9

1957
Application of the natural law varies greatly; it can de­
mand reflection that takes account of various conditions of life
according to places, times, and circumstances. Nevertheless, in the
diversity of cultures, the natural law remains as a rule that binds
men among themselves and imposes on them, beyond the inevita­
ble differences, common principles.
1958
The natural law is immutable and permanent throughout
the variations of history;10 it subsists under the flux of ideas and
customs and supports their progress. The rules that express it
remain substantially valid. Even when it is rejected in its very
principles, it cannot be destroyed or removed from the heart of
man. It always rises again in the life of individuals and societies:

2 072

Theft is surely punished by your law, O Lord, and by the law
that is written in the human heart, the law that iniquity itself
does not efface. 1 1

1959
The natural law, the Creator's very good work, provides
the solid foundation on which man can build the structure of moral
rules to guide his choices. It also provides the indispensable moral
foundation for building the human community. Finally, it provides
the necessary basis for the civil law with which it is connected,
whether by a reflection that draws conclusions from its principles,
or by additions of a positive and juridical nature.

The precepts of natural law are not perceived by everyone
clearly and immediately. In the present situation sinful man needs
grace and revelation so moral and religious truths may be known
"by everyone with facility, with firm certainty and with no admix­
ture of error." 12 The natural law provides revealed law and grace
with a foundation prepared by God and in accordance with the
work of the Spirit.

THE OLD LAW

1961
God, our Creator and Redeemer, chose Israel for himself
to be his people and revealed his Law to them, thus preparing for
the coming of Christ. The Law of Moses expresses many truths
naturally accessible to reason. These are stated and authenticated
within the covenant of salvation.
1962
The Old Law is the first stage of revealed Law. Its moral
prescriptions are summed up in the Ten Commandments. The
precepts of the Decalogue lay the foundations for the vocation of
man fashioned in the image of God; they prohibit what is contrary
to the love of God and neighbor and prescribe what is essential to
it. The Decalogue is a light offered to the conscience of every man
to make God's call and ways known to him and to protect him
against evil:
God wrote on the tables of the Law what men did not read
in their hearts. 13

According to Christian tradition, the Law is holy, spiritual,
and good, 14 yet still imperfect. Like a tutor15 it shows what must
be done, but does not of itself give the strength, the grace of the
Spirit, to fulfill it. Because of sin, which it cannot remove, it remains
a law of bondage. According to St. Paul, its special function is to
denounce and disclose sin, which constitutes a "law of concupiscence" in the human heart. 16 However, the Law remains the first
stage on the way to the kingdom. It prepares and disposes the
chosen people and each Christian for conversion and faith in the

Savior God. It provides a teaching which endures for ever, like the
Word of God.
The Old Law is a preparation for the Gospel. "The Law is a 1 22
pedagogy and a prophecy of things to come." 1 7 It prophesies and
presages the work of liberation from sin which will be fulfilled in
Christ: it provides the New Testament with images, "types," and
symbols for expressing the life according to the Spirit. Finally, the
Law is completed by the teaching of the sapiential books and the
prophets which set its course toward the New Covenant and the
Kingdom of heaven.
1964

There were . . . under the regimen of the Old Covenant,
people who possessed the charity and grace of the Holy
Spirit and longed above all for the spiritual and eternal
promises by which they were associated with the New Law.
Conversely, there exist carnal men under the New Covenant,
still distanced from the perfection of the New Law: the fear
of punishment and certain temporal promises have been
necessary, even under the New Covenant, to incite them to
virtuous works. In any case, even though the Old Law
prescribed charity, it did not give the Holy Spirit, throu gh
whom "God's charity has been poured into our hearts." 1

THE NEW LAW OR THE LAW OF THE GOSPEL

The New Law or the Law of the Gospel is the perfection 459
here on earth of the divine law, natural and revealed. It is the work
of Christ and is expressed particularly in the Sermon on the Mount.
It is also the work of the Holy Spirit and through him it becomes 581
the interior law of charity: "I will establish a New Covenant with
the house of Israel. . . . I will put my laws into their minds, and write
them on their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my 715
people." 19
1965

1966
The New Law is the grace of the Holy Spirit given to the 1 999
faithful through faith in Christ. It works through charity; it uses the
Sermon on the Mount to teach us what must be done and makes
use of the sacraments to give us the grace to do it:

Part Three

478

If anyone should medi tate with devotion and perspicacity
on the sermon our Lord gave on the mount, as we read in
the Gospel of Saint Matthew, he will doubtless find there . . . the
perfect way of the Christian life . . . . This sermon contains . . . all
the precepts needed to shape one's life. 20

1967
The Law of the Gospel "fulfills," refines, surpasses, and
leads the Old Law to its perfection. 21 In the Beatitudes, the New
577 Law fulfills the divine promises by elevating and orienting them
toward the "kingdom of heaven." It is addressed to those open to
accepting this new hope with faith - the poor, the humble, the
afflicted, the pure of heart, those persecuted on account of Christ ­
and so marks out the surprising ways of the Kingdom.
1968
The Law of the Gospelfulfills the commandments of the Law.
The Lord's Sermon on the Mount, far from abolishing or devaluing
the moral prescriptions of the Old Law, releases their hidden
129 potential and has new demands arise from them: it reveals their
entire divine and human truth. It does not add new external
precepts, but proceeds to reform the heart, the root of human acts,
582 where man chooses between the pure and the impure,22 where
faith, hope, and charity are formed and with them the other virtues.
The Gospel thus brings the Law to its fullness through imitation of
the perfection of the heavenly Father, through forgiveness of ene­
mies and prayer for persecutors, in emulation of the divine gener­
osity. 23
1 434

1969
The New Law practices the acts of religion: almsgiving,
prayer and fasting, directing them to the "Father who sees in
secret, " in contrast with the desire to "be seen by men." 24 Its prayer
is the Our Father. 25

1970
The Law of the Gospel requires us to make the decisive
choice between "the two ways" and to put into practice the words
1 696 of the Lord. 26 It is summed up in the Golden Rule, "Whatever you
1 789 wish that men would do to you, do so to them; this is the law and
the prophets." 27

The entire Law of the Gospel is contained in the "new
commandment" of Jesus, to love one another as he has loved us. 28

1 823

1971
To the Lord's Sermon on the Mount it is fitting to add
the moral catecltesis of the apostolic teachings, such as Romans 12-15,
1 Corin thians 1 2-13, Colossians 3-4, Ephesians 4-5, etc. This doctrine

hands on the Lord's teaching with the authority of the apostles,
particularly in the presentation of the virtues that flow from faith
in Christ and are animated by charity, the principal gift of the Holy
Spirit. "Let charity be genuine . . . . Love one another with brotherly
affection. . . . Rej oice in your hope, be patient in tribulation, bz
constant in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the saints, practice
hospitality. " 29 This catechesis also teaches us to deal with cases of 1 789
conscience in the light of our relationship to Christ and to the
Church. 30
The New Law is called a law of love because it makes us act 782
out of the love infused by the Holy Spirit, rather than from fear; a
law ofgrace, because it confers the strength of grace to act, by means
of faith and the sacraments; a law offreedom, because it sets us free
from the ritual and juridical observances of the Old Law, inclines
us to act spontaneously by the prompting of charity and, finally,
lets us pass from the condition of a servant who "does not know 1 828
what his master is doing" to that of a friend of Christ - "For all that
I have heard from my Father I have made known to you " - or even
to the status of son and heir. 31

1972

1973
Besides its precepts, the New Law also includes the evangelical counsels. The traditional distinction between God's com­

2053

mandments and the evangelical counsels is drawn in relation to
charity, the perfection of Christian life. The precepts are intended 915
to remove whatever is incompatible with charity. The aim of the
counsels is to remove whatever might hinder the development of
charity, even if it is not contrary to it. 32

1974
The evangelical counsels manifest the living fullness of
charity, which is never satisfied with not giving more. They attest
its vitality and call forth our spiritual readiness. The perfection of
the New Law consists essentially in the precepts of love of God and 2013
neighbor. The counsels point out the more direct ways, the readier
means, and are to be practiced in keeping with the vocation of each:

[God] does not want each person to keep all the counsels,
but only those appropriate to the diversity of persons, times,
opportunities, and strengths, as charity requires; for it is
charity, as queen of all virtues, all commandments, all coun­
sels, and, in short, of all laws and all Christian actions, that
gives to all of them their rank, order, time, and value.33

IN BRIEF

1975

According to Scripture the Law is a fatherly instruc­

lead to the promised beatitude, and proscribes the
ways of evil.

"Law is an ordinance of reason for the common good,
promulgated by the one who is in charge of the com­
munity" (St. Thomas Aquinas, STh 1-11, 90, 4).

Christ is the end of the law (cf. Rom 10:4); only he
teaches and bestows the justice of God.

1978

The natural law is a participation in God's wisdom
and goodness by man formed in the image of his
Creator. It expresses the dignity of the human person
and forms the basis of his fundamental rights and duties.

1979

The natural law is immutable, permanent throughout
history. The rules that express it remain substantially
valid. It is a necessary foundation for the erection of
moral rules and civil law.

1980

The Old Law is the first stage of revealed law. Its moral
prescriptions are summed up in the Ten Command­
ments.

1981

The Law of Moses contains many truths naturally
accessible to reason. God has revealed them because
men did not read them in their hearts.

1982

The Old Law is a preparation for the Gospel.

1983

The New Law is the grace of the Holy Spirit received by
faith in Christ, operating through charity. It finds expres­
sion above all in the Lord's Sermon on the Mount and
uses the sacraments to communicate grace to us.

The Law of the Gospel fulfills and surpasses the Old
Law and brings it to perfection: its promises, through
the Beatitudes of the Kingdom of heaven; its com­
mandments, by reforming the heart, the root of human
acts.

1985

The New Law is a law of love, a law of grace, a law of
freedom.

1986

Besides its precepts the New Law includes the evan­
gelical counsels. "The Church's holiness is fostered in
a special way by the manifold counsels which the Lord
proposes to his disciples in the Gospel" (LG 42 §2).

GRACE AND JUSTIFICATION
I.

JUSTIFICATION

1987 The grace of the Holy Spirit has the power to justify us,
that is, to cleanse us from our sins and to communicate to us "the
righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ" and through 734
Baptism: 34
But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also
live with him. For we know that Christ being raised from the
dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion
over him. The death he died he died to sin, once for all, but
the life he lives he lives to God . So you also must consider
yourselves as dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.35

1988
Through the power of the Holy Spirit we take part in
Christ's Passion by dying to sin, and in his Resurrection by being
born to a new life; we are members of his Body which is the Church, 654
branches grafted onto the vine which is hirnse1f: 36
[God] gave himself to us through his Spirit. By the participation of the Spirit, we become communicants in the divine
nature . . . . For this reason, those in whom the Spirit dwells
are divinized. 37

Part Three

1989
The first work of the grace of the Holy Spirit is conversion,
effecting justification in accordance with Jesus' proclamation at the
1427 beginning of the Gospel: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at
hand. " 38 Moved by grace, man turns toward God and away from
sin, thus accepting forgiveness and righteousness from on high.
"Justification is not only the remission of sins, but also the sancti­
fication and renewal of the interior man." 39
1990
Justification detaches man from sin which contradicts the
love of God, and purifies his heart of sin. Justification follows upon
1 446 God's merciful initiative of offering forgiveness. It reconciles man
1 733 with God. It frees from the enslavement to sin, and it heals.
1991
Justification is at the same time the acceptance of God's
righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ. Righteousness (or "jus­
tice") here means the rectitude of divine love. With justification,

1 8 1 2 faith, hope, and charity are poured into our hearts, and obedience

to the divine will is granted us.

1992
Justification has been merited for us by the Passion of Christ
who offered himself on the cross as a living victim, holy and
pleasing to God, and whose blood has become the instrument of
atonement for the sins of all men. Justification is conferred in
1 2 6 6 Baptism, the sacrament of faith. It conforms us to the righteousness
of God, who makes us inwardly just by the power of his mercy. Its
294 purpose is the glory of God and of Christ, and the gift of eternal
life: 40
61 7

But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart
from law, although the law and the prophets bear witness to
it, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for
all who believe. For there is no distinction: since all have
sinned and fall short of the glory of God, they are justified
by his grace as a gift, through the redemption which is in
Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as an expiation by his
blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's
righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had
passed over former sins; it was to prove at the present time
that he himself is righteous and that he justifies him who has
faith in Jesus. 41

1993
Justification establishes cooperation between God's grace and
man 's freedom. On man's part it is expressed by the assent of faith

2008

to the Word of God, which invites him to conversion, and in the
cooperation of charity with the prompting of the Holy Spirit who
precedes and preserves his assent:
When God touches man's heart through the illumination of
the Holy Spirit, man himself is not inactive while receiving
that inspiration, since he could rej ect it; and yet, without
God's grace, he cannot by his own free will move himself
toward justice in God's sight.42

1994
Justification is the most excellent work of God's love made
manifest in Christ Jesus and granted by the Holy Spirit. It is the
opinion of St. Augustine that "the justification of the wicked is a
greater work than the creation of heaven and earth," because
"heaven and earth will pass away but the salvation and justification of the elect . . . will not pass away." 43 He holds also that the
justification of sinners surpasses the creation of the angels in justice, in that it bears witness to a greater mercy.
The Holy Spirit is the master of the interior life. By giving
birth to the "inner man," 44 justification entails the sanctification of
his whole being:

Just as you once yielded your members to impurity and to
greater and greater iniquity, so now yield your members to
righteousness for sanctification . . . . But now that you have
been set free from sin and have become slaves of God the
4
return you get is sanctification and its end, eternal life. 5

II.

GRACE

1996
Our justification comes from the grace of God. Grace is
favor, the free and undeserved help that God gives us to respond to
his call to become children of God, adoptive sons, partakers of the
divine nature and of eternal life. 46

153

1997
Grace is a participation in the life of God. It introduces us into 375
the intimacy of Trinitarian life: by Baptism the Christian partici- 260
pates in the grace of Christ, the Head of his Body. As an "adopted

'
son" he can henceforth call God "Father," in union with the only
Son . He receives the life of the Spirit who breathes charity into him
and who forms the Church.
1 71 9

1998
This vocation to eternal life is supernatural. It depends
entirely on God 's gratuitous initiative, for he alone can reveal and
give himself. It surpasses the power of human intellect and will, as
that of every other creature. 47

1999
The grace of Christ is the gratuitous gift that God makes
to us of his own life, infused by the Holy Spirit into our soul to heal
1 966 it of sin and to sanctify it. It is the sanct ifying or de ify ing grace
received in Baptism. It is in us the source of the work of sanctifica­
tion: 48
Therefore if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old
has passed away, behold, the new has come. All this is from
God, who through Christ reconciled us to himse1f. 49

Sanctifying grace is an habitual gift, a stable and super­
natural disposition that perfects the soul itself to enable it to live
with God, to act by his love. Habitual grace, the permanent disposi­
tion to live and act in keeping with God's call, is distinguished from
actual graces which refer to God's interventions, whether at the
beginning of conversion or in the course of the work of sanctifica­
tion.

2000

490

2001
The preparation of man for the reception of grace is already
a work of grace. This latter is needed to arouse and sustain our
collaboration in justification through faith, and in sanctification
through charity. God brings to completion in us what he has begun,
"since he who completes his work by cooperating with our will
began by working so that we might will it:" 50
Indeed we also war k, but we are only collaborating with God
who works, for his mercy has gone before us. It has gone
before us so that we may be healed, and follows us so that
once healed, we may be given life; it goes before us so that
we rna y be called, and follows us so that we may be glorified;
it goes before us so that we may live devoutly, and follows
us so that we m7;i always live with God : for without him we
can do nothing.

2002
God's free initiative demands man 's free response, for God
has created man in his image by conferring on him, along with
freedom, the power to know him and love him. The soul only 1 742
enters freely into the communion of love. God immediately
touches and directly moves the heart of man. He has placed in man
a longing for truth and goodness that only he can satisfy. The
promises of "eternal life" respond, beyond all hope, to this desire:
If at the end of your very good works . . . , you rested on the
seventh day, it was to foretell by the voice of your book that
at the end of our works, which are indeed "very good" since
you have given them to us, we shall also rest in you on the
sabbath of eternal life. 52

2003
Grace is first and foremost the gift of the Spirit who justifies 1 1 08
and sanctifies us. But grace also includes the gifts that the Spirit
grants us to associate us with his work, to enable us to collaborate
in the salvation of others and in the growth of the Body of Christ,
the Church. There are sacramental graces, gifts proper to the differ- 1 1 2 7
ent sacraments. There are furthermore special graces, also called
charisms after the Greek term used by St. Paul and meaning " favor,"
"gratuitous gift," "benefit. " 53 Whatever their character - sometimes it is extraordinary, such as the gift of miracles or of tongues
- charisms are oriented toward sanctifying grace and are intended 799-801
for the common good of the Church. They are at the service of
charity which builds up the Church. 54
2004
Among the special graces ought to be mentioned the graces
of state that accompany the exercise of the responsibilities of the
Christian life and of the ministries within the Church:
Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let
us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith; if service,
in our serving; he who teaches, in his teaching; he who
exhorts, in his exhortation; he who contributes, in liberality;
he who gives aid, with zeal; he who does acts of mercy, with
cheerfulness.55

486

Part Three

2005
Since it belongs to the supernatural order, grace escapes our
experience and cannot be known except by faith. We cannot there­

fore rely on our feelings or our works to conclude that we are
justified and saved. 56 However, according to the Lord's words "Thus you will know them by their fruits" 57 - reflection on God's
blessings in our life and in the lives of the saints offers us a
guarantee that grace is at work in us and spurs us on to an ever
greater faith and an attitude of trustful poverty.
A pleasing illustration of this attitude is found in the reply
of St. Joan of Arc to a question posed as a trap by her
ecclesiastical judges: "Asked if she knew that she was in
God's grace, she replied: 'If I am not, may it please God to
put me in it; if I am, may it please God to keep me there.'"58

III.

MERIT

You are glorified in the assembly of your Holy Ones,for in
crowning their merits you are crowning your own gifts.59

2006
The term "merit" refers in general to the recompense owed
by a community or a society for the action of one of its members,
experienced either as beneficial or harmful, deserving reward or
1 807 punishment. Merit is relative to the virtue of justice, in conformity
with the principle of equality which governs it.
1 723

2007

With regard to God, there is no strict right to any merit on

42 the part of man. Between God and us there is an immeasurable

inequality, for we have received everything from him, our Creator.

The merit of man before God in the Christian life arises
from the fact that God has freely chosen to associate man with the work
306 of his grace. The fatherly action of God is first on his own initiative,
1 55 and then follows man's free acting through his collaboration, so
970 that the merit of good works is to be attributed in the first place to
the grace of God, then to the faithful. Man's merit, moreover, itself
is due to God, for his good actions proceed in Christ, from the
predispositions and assistance given by the Holy Spirit.

Filial adoption, in making us partakers by grace in the
divine nature, can bestow true merit on us as a result of God's
gratuitous justice. This is our right by grace, the full right of love,
making us "co-heirs" with Christ and worthy of obtaining "the
promised inheritance of eternal life." 60 The merits of our good
works are gifts of the divine goodness. 61 "Grace has gone before
us; now we are given what is due . . . . Our merits are God's gifts. " 62 604
2010
Since the initiative belongs to God in the order of grace, no
one can merit the i11itial grace of forgiveness and justification, at the

1 998

beginning of conversion. Moved by the Holy Spirit and by charity,

we can then merit for ourselves and for others the graces needed for

our sanctification, for the increase of grace and charity, and for the
attainment of eternal life. Even temporal goods like health and
friendship can be merited in accordance with God's wisdom. These
graces and goods are the object of Christian prayer. Prayer attends
to the grace we need for meritorious actions.

The charity of Christ is the source in us of all our merits before 492
God. Grace, by uniting us to Christ in active love, ensures the
supernatural quality of our acts and consequently their merit before God and before men. The saints have always had a lively
awareness that their merits were pure grace.

2011

After earth's exile, I hope to go and enjoy you in the father­
land, but I do not want to lay up merits for heaven. I want
to work for your love alone .
In the evening of this life, I
shall appear before you with empty hands, for I do not ask
you, Lord, to count my works. All our justice is blemished
in your eyes. I wish, then, to be clothed in your own justice
and to receive from your love the eternal possession of your.

CHRISTIAN HOLINESS

"We know that in everything God works for good with
those who love him . . . For those whom he foreknew he also
459 predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that
he might be the first-born among many brethren. And those whom
he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also
justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified." 64

2012

2013

"All Christians in any state or walk of life are called to the

9 1 5, 2545 fullness of Christian life and to the perfection of charity." 65 All are

825 called to holiness: "Be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect." 66

In order to reach this perfection the faithful should use the
strength dealt out to them by Christ's gift, so that . . . doing
the will of the Father in everything, they may wholeheart­
edly devote themselves to the glory of God and to the service
of their neighbor. Thus the holiness of the People of God will
grow in fruitful abundance, as is clearly shown in the history
of the Church through the lives of so many saints.67

Spiritual progress tends toward ever more intimate union
with Christ. This union is called "mystical" because it participates
774 in the mystery of Christ through the sacraments - "the holy mys­
teries" - and, in him, in the mystery of the Holy Trinity. God calls
us all to this intimate union with him, even if the special graces or
extraordinary signs of this mystical life are granted only to some
for the sake of manifesting the gratuitous gift given to all.

2014

2015
The way of perfection passes by way of the Cross. There is
no holiness without renunciation and spiritual battle. 68 Spiritual
407, 2 725 progress entails the ascesis and mortification that gradually lead
1 438 to living in the peace and joy of the Beatitudes:
He who climbs never stops going from beginning to begin­
ning, through beginnings that have no end . He never stops
desiring what he already knows. 69

the "blessed hope" of those whom the divine mercy gathers into

God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband." 71

IN BRIEF

2017

The grace of the Holy Spirit confers upon us the right­
eousness of God. Uniting us by faith and Baptism to
the Passion and Resurrection of Christ, the Spirit
makes us sharers in his life.

2018

Like conversion, justification has two aspects. Moved by
grace, man turns toward God and away from sin, and so
accepts forgiveness and righteousness from on high.

2019

Justification includes the remission of sins, sanctifica­
tion, and the renewal of the inner man.

2020

Justification has been merited for us by the Passion of
Christ. It is granted us through Baptism. It conforms us
to the righteousness of God, who justifies us. It has for
its goal the glory of God and of Christ, and the gift of
eternal life. It is the most excellent work of God's mercy.

2021

Grace is the help God gives us to respond to our
vocation of becoming his adopted sons. It introduces
us into the intimacy of the Trinitarian life.

2022

The divine initiative in the work of grace precedes, pre­
pares, and elicits the free response of man. Grace re­
sponds to the deepest yearnings of human freedom, calls
freedom to cooperate with it, and perfects freedom.

2023

Sanctifying grace is the gratuitous gift of his life that
God makes to us; it is infused by the Holy Spirit into
the soul to heal it of sin and to sanctify it.

2024

Sanc tifying grace makes us " p leasing to G o d . "
Charisms, special graces of the Holy Spirit, are ori­
ented to sanctifying grace and are intended for the

common good of the Church. God also acts through
many actual graces, to be distinguished from habitual
grace which is permanent in us.

2025

We can have merit in God's sight only because of
God's free plan to associate man with the work of his
grace. Merit is to be ascribed in the first place to the
grace of God, and secondly to man's collaboration.
Man's merit is due to God.

2026

The grace of the Holy Spirit can confer true merit on
us, by virtue of our adoptive filiation, and in accord­
ance with God's gratuitous justice. Charity is the prin­
cipal source of merit in us before God.

2027

No one can merit the initial grace which is at the origin
of conversion. Moved by the Holy Spirit, we can merit
for ourselves and for others all the graces needed to
attain eternal life, as well as necessary temporal goods.

2028

"All Christians . . . are called to the fullness of Christian
life and to the perfection of charity" (LG 40 § 2). "Chris­
tian perfection has but one limit, that of having none"

THE CHURCH, MOTHER AND TEACHER

2030
It is in the Church, in communion with all the baptized,
that the Christian fulfills his vocation. From the Church he receives
the Word of God containing the teachings of "the law of Christ." 72
From the Church he receives the grace of the sacraments that
sustains him on the "way." From the Church he learns the example
82 8 of holiness and recognizes its model and source in the all-holy
Virgin Mary; he discerns it in the authentic witness of those who
live it; he discovers it in the spiritual tradition and long history of
the saints who have gone before him and whom the liturgy cele1 1 72 brates in the rhythms of the sanctoral cycle.

The moral life is spiritual worship. We "present [our] bodies
as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God," 73 within the Body
of Christ that we form and in communion with the offering of his 1 368
Eucharist. In the liturgy and the celebration of the sacraments,
prayer and teaching are conjoined with the grace of Christ to
enlighten and nourish Christian activity. As does the whole of the
Christian life, the moral life finds its source and s umm it in the
Eucharistic sacrifice.

MORAL LIFE AND THE MAGISTERIUM O F THE CHURCH

85-87
888-892

2032
The Church, the "pillar and bulwark of the truth," "has
received this solemn command of Christ from the apostles to
announce the saving truth." 74 "To the Church belongs the right
always and everywhere to announce moral principles, including
those pertaining to the social order, and to make judgments on any 2246
human affairs to the extent that they are required by the fundamental rights of the human person or the salvation of souls. " 75
2420
2033
The Magisterium of the Pastors ofthe Church in moral matters
is ordinarily exercised in catechesis and preaching, with the help
of the works of theologians and spiritual authors. Thus from
generation to generation, under the aegis and vigilance of the
pastors, the "deposit" of Christian moral teaching has been handed 84
on, a deposit composed of a characteristic body of rules, command­
ments, and virtues proceeding from faith in Christ and animated
by charity. Alongside the Creed and the Our Father, the basis for
this catechesis has traditionally been the Decalogue which sets out
the principles of moral life valid for all men.
2034
The Roman Pontiff and the bishops are "authentic teach­
ers, that is, teachers endowed with the authority of Christ, who
preach the faith to the people entrusted to them, the faith to be
believed and put into practice." 76 The ordinary and universal
Magisterium of the Pope and the bishops in communion with him
teach the faithful the truth to believe, the charity to practice, the
beatitude to hope for.

The supreme degree of 'participation in the authority of
Christ is ensured by the charism of infallibility. This infallibility
extends as far as does the deposit of divine Revelation; it also
extends to all those elements of doctrine, including morals, without
which the saving truths of the faith cannot be preserved, explained,
or observed. 77
2036
The authority of the Magisterium extends also to the spe­
cific precepts of the natural law, because their observance, de1 960 manded by the Creator, is necessary for salvation. In recalling the
prescriptions of the natural law, the Magisterium of the Church
exercises an essential part of its prophetic office of proclaiming to
men what they truly are and reminding them of what they should
be before God?B
The law of God entrusted to the Church is taught to the
faithful as the way of life and truth. The faithful therefore have the
right to be instructed in the divine saving precepts that purify
judgment and, with grace, heal wounded human reason. 79 They
have the duty of observing the constitutions and decrees conveyed
2041 by the legitimate authority of the Church. Even if they concern
disciplinary matters, these determinations call for docility in char­
ity.

2037

2038
In the work of teaching and applying Christian morality,
the Church needs the dedication of pastors, the knowledge of
theologians, and the contribution of all Christians and men of good
2442 will. Faith and the practice of the Gospel provide each person with
an experience of life "in Christ," who enlightens him and makes
him able to evaluate the divine and human realities according to
the Spirit of God .so Thus the Holy Spirit can use the humblest to
enlighten the learned and those in the highest positions.

Ministries should be exercised in a spirit of fraternal service and dedication to the Church, in the name of the Lord. 81 At the
same time the conscience of each person should avoid confining
itself to individualistic considerations in its moral judgments of the
person's own acts. As far as possible conscience should take ac­
count of the good of all, as expressed in the moral law, natural and
revealed, and consequently in the law of the Church and in the
authoritative teaching of the Magisterium on moral questions.
Personal conscience and reason should not be set in opposition to 1 783
the moral law or the Magisterium of the Church.

Thus a truefilial spirit toward the Church can develop among
Christians . It is the normal flowering of the baptismal grace which
has begotten us in the womb of the Church and made us members
of the Body of Christ. In her motherly care, the Church grants us
the mercy of God which prevails over all our sins and is especially
at work in the sacrament of reconciliation. With a mother's fore­
sight, she also lavishes on us day after day in her liturgy the 1 6 7
nourishment o f the Word and Eucharist o f the Lord .

THE PRECEPTS

OF THE CHURCH

2041
The precepts of the Church are set in the context of a moral
life bound to and nourished by liturgical life. The obligatory char­
acter of these positive laws decreed by the pastoral authorities is
meant to guarantee to the faithful the very necessary minimum in
the spirit of prayer and moral effort, in the growth in love of God
and neighbor:
2042
The first precept ("You shall attend Mass on Sundays and on holy
days of obligation and rest from servile labor") requires the faithful to 1 3 89
sanctify the day commemorating the Resurrection of the Lord as well as 2 1 80
the principle liturgical feasts honoring the mysteries of the Lord, the
Blessed Virgin Mary, and the saints; in the first place, by participating in
the Eucharistic celebration, in which the Christian community is gathered,
and by resting from those works and activities which could impede such
2
a sanctification of these days. 8
The second precept ("You shall confess your sins at least once a
year.") ensures preparation for the Eucharist by the reception of the 1 457
sacrament of reconciliation, which continues Baptism's work of conversion and forgiveness. 83

The third precept ("You shall receive the sacrament of the Eucharist at least during the Easter season") guarantees as a minimum the
reception of the Lord's Body and Blood in connection with the Paschal
feasts, the origin and center of the Christian liturgy. 84

2043
The fourth precept ("You shall observe the days of fasting and
abstinence establ ished by the Church") ensures the times of ascesis and
2 1 77 penance which prepare us for the liturgical feasts and help us acquire
mastery over our instincts and freedom of heart. 85
The fifth precept ("You shall help to provide for the needs of the
1 387
1 438 Church") means that the faithful are obliged to assist with the material
needs of the Church, each according to his own ability. 86
1 351

The faithful also have the duty of providing for the material
needs of the Church, each according to his abilities. 87

Ill.

MORAL LIFE AND MISSIONARY WITNESS

2044
852, 905

The fidelity of the baptized is a primordial condition for
the proclamation of the Gospel and for the Church's mission in the
world. In order that the message of salvation can show the power
of its truth and radiance before men, it must be authenticated by
the witness of the life of Christians. "The witness of a Christian life
and good works done in a supernatural spirit have great power to
draw men to the faith and to God." 88

753 2045

828

Because they are members of the Body whose Head is
Christ,89 Christians contribute to building up the Church by the
constancy of their convictions and their moral lives . The Church
increases, grows, and develops through the holiness of her faithful,
until "we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge
of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature
of the fullness of Chris t." 9 0

2046
By living with the mind of Christ, Christians hasten the coming
of the Reign of God, "a kingdom of justice, love, and peace."9 1 They do
671, 281 9

not, for all that, abandon their earthly tasks; faithful to their master,
they fulfill them with uprightness, pa tience, and love.

IN BRIEF
2047

The moral life is a spiritual worship . Christian activity

finds its nourishment in the liturgy and the celebration

of the sacraments .

2048

The precepts of the Church concern the moral and Chris­
tian life united with the liturgy and nourished by it.

2049

The Magisterium of the Pas tors of the Church in moral

ma tters is ordinarily exercised in ca techesis and

preaching, on the basis of the Decalogue which states

the principles of moral life valid for every man.

2050

The Roman Pontiff and the bishops, as authentic teach­

ers, preach to the People of God the faith which is to

be believed and applied in moral life . It is also incum­

bent on them to pronounce on moral questions that fall
within the natural law and reason.

2051

The infallibility of the Magisterium of the Pastors ex­
tends to all the elements of doctrine, including moral

doctrine, without which the saving truths of the faith
cannot be preserved, expounded, or observed .

S ECTION Two
THE TEN COMMANDMENTS
"Teacher, what must I do

.

.

.

?"

2052

"Teacher, what good deed must I do, to have eternal life?"
To the yormg man who asked this question, Jesus answers first by
invoking the necessity to recognize God as the "One there is who
is good/' as the supreme G ood and the source of all good. Then
Jesus tells him: "If you would enter life, keep the commandments. "
1 858 And h e cites for his questioner the precepts that concern love of
neighbor: "You shall not kill, You shall not commit adultery, You
shall not steat You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father
and mother. " Finally Jesus sums up these commandments posi­
tively: "You shall love your neighbor as yoursel£." 1

2053
To this first reply Jesus adds a second: "If you would be
perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will
have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me." 2 This reply does
not do away with the first: following Jesus Christ involves keeping
the Commandments. The Law has not been abolished, 3 but rather
1 968 man is invited to rediscover it in the person of his Master who is
its perfect fulfillment. In the three synoptic Gospels, Jesus' call to
the rich young man to follow him, in the obedience of a disciple
and in the observance of the Commandments, is joined to the call
1 973 to poverty and chastity. 4 The evangelical cormsels are inseparable
from the Commandments.
2054
Jesus acknowledged the Ten Commandments, but he also
showed the power of the Spirit at work in their letter. He preached
581 a "righteousness [which] exceeds that of the scribes and Phari­
sees" 5 as well as that of the Gentiles. 6 He rmfolded all the demands
of the Commandments. "You have heard that it was said to the
men of old, 'You shall not kill. ' . . . But I say to you that every one
who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment." 7

2055 When someone asks him, "Which commandment in the
Law is the greatest?" 8 Jesus replies: "You shall love the Lord your
God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your 1 2 9
mind. This is the greatest and first commandment. And a second
is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two
commandments hang all the Law and the prophets." 9 The Deca­
logue must be interpreted in light of this twofold yet single com­
mandment of love, the fullness of the Law:
The commandments: "You shall not commit adultery, You
shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not covet," and
any other commandment, are summed up in this sentence:
"You shall love your neighbor as yourself." Love does no
wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the
T
law .H

The Decalogue in Sacred Scripture
The word "Decalogue" means literally "ten words." 1 1 God
revealed these "ten words" to his people on the holy mountain.
They were written "with the finger of God," 12 unlike the other 700
commandments written by Moses. 13 They are pre-eminently the 62
words of God. They are handed on to us in the books of Exodus 14
and Deuteronomy. l 5 Beginn in g with the Old Testament, the sacred
books refer to the "ten words," 1 6 but it is in the New Covenant in
Jesus Christ that their full meaning will be revealed.

2056

The Decalogue must first be understood in the context of
the Exodus, God's great liberating event at the center of the Old
Covenant. Whether formulated as negative commandments, pro- 2084
hibitions, or as positive precepts such as: "Honor your father and
mother," the "ten words" point out the conditions of a life freed
from the slavery of sin. The Decalogue is a path of life:

2057

If you love the LORD your God, by walking in his ways, and
by keeping his commandments and his statutes and his
ordinances, then you shall live and multiply. 17

17 Deut 30:16.

500
2 1 70

Part Three

This liberating power of the Decalogue appears, for example, in the commandment about the sabbath rest, directed also to
foreigners and slaves:
You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of
Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out thence with
l
a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. 8

1 962

2058
The "ten words" sum up and proclaim God's law : "These
words the Lord spoke to all your assembly at the mountain out of
the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a loud
voice; and he added no more. And he wrote them upon two tables
of stone, and gave them to me." 19 For this reason these two tables
are called "the Testimony." In fact, they contain the terms of the
covenant concluded between God and his people. These "tables of
the Testimony" were to be deposited in "the ark." 20

2059
The "ten words" are pronounced by God in the midst of a
theophany ("The LORD spoke with you face to face at the mountain,
out of the midst of the fire. " 21 ). They belong to God's revelation of
himself and his glory. The gift of the Commandments is the gift of
2 823 God himself and his holy will. In making his will known, God
reveals himself to his people.
707

2060
The gift of the commandments and of the Law is part of
the covenant God sealed with his own. In Exodus, the revelation of
the "ten words" is granted between the proposal of the covenant22
and its conclusion - after the people had committed themselves to
"do" all that the Lord had said, and to "obey" it. 23 The Decalogue
62 is never handed on without first recalling the covenant ("The LORD
our God made a covenant with us in Horeb."). 24
The Commandments take on their full meaning within the
covenant. According to Scripture, man's moral life has all its mean­
ing in and through the covenant. The first of the "ten words" recalls
that God loved his people first:

23 Cf. Ex 24:7.
24 Deut 5:2.

Life in Christ

501

Since there was a passing from the paradise of freedom to
the slavery of this world, in punishment for sin, the first
phrase of the Decalogue, the first word of God's command­
ments, bears on freedom: "I am the LORD your God, who
brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of
slavery."25

2 086

2062
The Conunandments properly so-called come in the second place: they express the implications of belonging to God
through the establishment of the covenant. Moral existence is a
response to the Lord's loving initiative. It is the acknowledgement 1 42
and homage given to God and a worship of thanksgiving. It is 2 002
cooperation with the plan God pursues in history.
The covenant and dialogue between God and man are also
attested to by the fact that all the obligations are stated in the first
person ("I am the Lord .") and addressed by God to another per­
sonal subj ect ("you"). In all God's commandments, the singular
personal pronoun designates the recipient. God makes his will 878
known to each person in particular, at the same time as he makes
it known to the whole people:

2063

The Lord prescribed love towards God and taught j ustice
towards neighbor, so that man would be neither unjust, nor
unworthy of God. Thus, through the Decalogue, God pre­
pared man to become his friend and to live in harmony with
his neighbor . . . . The words of the Decalogue remain likewise
for us Christians. Far from being abolished, they have re­
ceived amplification and development from the fact of the
coming of the Lord in the flesh. 26

The Decalogue in the Church's Tradition
In fidelity to Scripture and in conformity with the example
of Jesus, the tradition of the Church has acknowledged the primor­
dial importance and significance of the Decalogue.

2064

2065

Ever since St. Augustine, the Ten Command ments have occupied
a predominant place in the catechesis of baptismal candidates and the
faithful. In the fifteenth century, the custom arose of expressing the com­
mandments of the Decalogue in rhymed formulae, easy to memorize and
in positive form. They are still in use today. The catechisms of the Church
have often expounded Christian morality by following the order of the Ten
Commandments.

26 St. Irenaeus, Adv. luleres., 4, 16, 3-4: PG 7/1, 1017-1018.

502

Part Three

2066

The division and numbering of the Commandments have varied
in the course of history. The present catechism follows the division of the
Commandments established by St. Augustine, which has become tradi­
tional in the Catholic Church. It is also that of the Lutheran confessions.
The Greek Fathers worked out a slightly different division, which is found
in the Orthodox Churches and Reformed communities.

The Ten Commandments state what is required in the love
of God and love of neighbor. The first three concern love of God,
1 853 and the other seven love of neighbor.

2067

As charity comprises the two commandments to which the
Lord related the whole Law and the prophets . . . so the Ten
Commandments were themselves given on two tablets.
Three were written on one tablet and seven on the other. 27

The Council of Trent teaches that the Ten Commandments
are obligatory for Christians and that the justified man is still
1 993 bound to keep them;28 the Second Vatican Council confirms: "The
bishops, successors of the apostles, receive from the Lord . . . the
mission of teaching all peoples, and of preaching the G ospel to
888 every creature, so that all men may attain salvation through faith,
Baptism and the observance of the Commandments. " 29

2068

The unity of the Decalogue

2069
The Decalogue forms a coherent whole. Each "word" re­
fers to each of the others and to all of them; they reciprocally
2534 condition one another. The two tables shed light on one another;
they form an organic unity. To transgress one commandment is to
infringe all the others. 30 One cannot honor another person without
blessing God his Creator. One cannot adore God without loving all
men, his creatures. The Decalogue brings man's religious and
social life into unity.
The Decalogue and the natural law
1 955

The Ten Commandments belong to God's revelation. At
the same time they teach us the true humanity of man. They bring
to light the essential duties, and therefore, indirectly, the funda­
mental rights inherent in the nature of the human person. The
Decalogue contains a privileged expression of the natural law:

Life in Christ

503

From the beginning, God had implanted in the heart of man
the p recepts of the natural law. Then he was content to
remind him of them. This was the Decalogue.31

The commandments of the Decalogue, although accessible
2071
to reason alone, have been revealed. To attain a complete and
certain understanding of the requirements of the natural law, sinful
humanity needed this revelation:

1 960

A full explanation of the commandments of the Decalogue
became necessary in the state of sin because the light of
reason was obscured and the will had gone astray.32

We know God's commandments through the divine revelation proposed to us in the Church, and through the voice of moral
conscience.

1 777

The obligation of the Decalogue

2072
Since they express man's fundamental duties towards God
and towards his neighbor, the Ten Commandments reveal, in their
primordial content, grave obligations. They are fundamentally immutable, and they oblige always and everywhere. No one can
dispense from them. The Ten Commandments are engraved by
God in the human heart.

1 858
1 958

2073
Obedience to the Commandments also implies obligations
in matter which is, in itself, light. Thus abusive language is forbid­
den by the fifth commandment, but would be a grave offense only
as a result of circumstances or the offender's intention.
"Apart from me you can do nothing"

2074 Jesus says: "I am the vine, you are the branches. He who
abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from
me you can do nothing."33 The fruit referred to in this saying is the
holiness of a life made fruitful by union with Christ. When we believe
in Jesus Christ, partake of his mysteries, and keep his commandments,
the Savior himself comes to love, in us, his Father and his brethren,
our Father and our brethren. His person becomes, through the Spirit,
the living and interior rule of our activity. "This is my commandment,
that you love one another as I have loved you."34

CHAPTER ONE
"You SHALL LovE THE LoRD YoUR Goo
WITH

ALL YouR HEART, AND WITH ALL YoUR
SoUL, AND WITH ALL YoUR MIND"

Jesus summed up man's duties toward God in this saying: 367
"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all
your soul, and with all your mind. " 1 This immediately echoes the
solemn call: "Hear, 0 Israel: the LORD our God is one LORD." 2

2083

God has loved us first. The love of the One God is recalled
in the first of the "ten words." The commandments then make
explicit the response of love that man is called to give to his God.

1 99

ARTICLE 1
THE FIRST COMMANDMENT
I am the LoRD your God, who brought you out of the land
of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. You shall have no
other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself a
graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven
above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water
under the earth; you shall not bow down to them or serve
them. 3
It is written: "You shall worship the Lord your God and him
only shall you serve." 4
I.

"You SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YouR GOD
AND HIM ONLY SHALL You SERVE"

2084
God makes himself known by recalling his all-powerful,
loving, and liberating action in the history of the one he addresses:
"I brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of 2 057
bondage. " The first word contains the first commandment of the
Law: "You shall fear the LORD your G od; you shall serve him. . . .
You shall not go after other gods. " 5 God's first call and just demand
398
is that man accept him and worship him.
1 Mt 22 :37; cf. Lk 10: 27: " . . . and with all your strength."

4 Mt 4:10.
5 Deut 6:13-14.

506

Part Three

The one and true God first reveals his glory to Israel. 6 The
revelation of the vocation and truth of man is linked to the revela200 tion of God. Man's vocation is to make God manifest by acting in
1 701 conformity with his creation "in the image and likeness of God":

2085

There will never be another God, Trypho, and there has been
no other since the world began . . . than he who made and
ordered the universe. We do not think that our God is
different from yours. He is the same who brought your
fathers out of Egyp t "by his powerful hand and his out­
stretched arm." We do not place our hope in some other god,
for there is none, but in the same God as you do: the God of
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob ?

2086
"The first commandment embraces faith, hope, and char­
ity. When we say 'God' we confess a constant, unchangeable being,
2 1 2 always the same, faithful and just, without any evil. It follows that
we must necessarily accept his words and have complete faith in
him and acknowledge his authority. He is almighty, merciful, and
infinitely beneficent. . . . Who could not place all hope in him? Who
could not love him when contemplating the treasures of goodness
and love he has poured out on us? Hence the formula God employs
2061 in the Scripture at the beginning and end of his commandments: 'I
am the LORD. "' 8

1 81 4-1 81 6

Faith

Our moral life has its source in faith in God who reveals
his love to us. St. Paul speaks of the "obedience of faith" 9 as our
143 first obligation. He shows that "ignorance of God" is the principle
and explanation of all moral deviations. 1 D Our duty toward God is
to believe in him and to bear witness to him.

2087

The first commandment requires us to nourish and protect
our faith with prudence and vigilance, and to reject everything that
is opposed to it. There are various ways of sinning against faith:

2088

157

Voluntary doubt about the faith disregards or refuses to
hold as true what God has revealed and the Church proposes for
belief. Involuntary doubt refers to hesitation in believing, difficulty

in overcoming objections connected with the faith, or also anxiety
aroused by its obscurity. If deliberately cultivated doubt can lead
to spiritual blindness.

Incredulity is the neglect of revealed truth or the willful 1 62
refusal to assent to it. "Heresy is the obstinate post-baptismal denial 81 7
of some truth which must be believed with divine and catholic
faith, or it is likewise an obstinate doubt concerning the same;
apostasy is the total repudiation of the Christian faith; schism is the
refusal of submission to the Roman Pontiff or of communion with
the members of the Church subject to him." 1 1

Hope

1 81 7- 1 821

When God reveals Himself and calls him, man cannot fully
respond to the divine love by his own powers. He must hope that
God will give him the capacity to love Him in return and to act in 1 996
conformity with the commandments of charity. Hope is the confident expectation of divine blessing and the beatific vision of God;
it is also the fear of offending God's love and of incurring punishment.

2090

2091
The first commandment is also concerned with sins
against hope, namely, despair and presumption:
By despair, man ceases to hope for his personal salvation
from God, for help in attaining it or for the forgiveness of his sins. 1 864
Despair is contrary to God's goodness, to his justice - for the Lord
is faithful to his promises - and to his mercy.

2092
There are two kinds of presumption. Either man presumes
upon his own capacities, (hoping to be able to save himself without
help from on high), or he presumes upon God's almighty power 2 732
or his mercy {hoping to obtain his forgiveness without conversion
and glory without merit) .

Part Three

1 822- 1 829 Charity
2093
Faith in God's love encompasses the call and the obligation
to respond with sincere love to divine charity. The first command­
ment enjoins us to love God above everything and all creatures for
him and because of him. 12
2094

One can sin against God's love in various ways:

- indifference neglects or refuses to reflect on divine charity; it fails
to consider its prevenient goodness and denies its power.

- ingratitude fails or refuses to acknowledge divine charity and to
return him love for love.
- lukewarmness is hesitation or negligence in responding to divine
love; it can imply refusal to give oneself over to the prompting of
charity.
2 733

- acedia or spiritual sloth goes so far as to refuse the joy that comes
from God and to be repelled by divine goodness.

2303

- hatred ofGod comes from pride. It is contrary to love of God, whose
goodness it denies, and whom it presumes to curse as the one who
forbids sins and inflicts punishments.

II.

"HIM ONLY SHALL You SERVE"

2095
The theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity inform
and give life to the moral virtues. Thus charity leads us to render
1 807 to God what we as creatures owe him in all justice. The virtue of
religion disposes us to have this attitude.
2628

Adoration
Adoration is the first act of the virtue of religion. To adore
God is to acknowledge him as God, as the Creator and Savior, the
Lord and Master of everything that exists, as infinite and merciful
Love. "You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall
you serve," says Jesus, citing Deuteronomy. l 3

2096

1 2 Cf. Deut 6:4-5.
13 Lk 4:8; cf. Deut 6:13.

Life in Christ

509

2097

To adore God is to acknowledge, in respect and absolute
submission, the "nothingness of the creature" who would not exist
but for God. To adore God is to praise and exalt him and to humble
oneself, as Mary did in the Magnificat, confessing with gratitude
that he has done great things and holy is his name. l 4 The worship
of the one God sets man free from turning in on himself, from the
slavery of sin and the idolatry of the world.

2807

Prayer

2558

The acts of faith, hope, and charity enjoined by the first
commandment are accomplished in prayer. Lifting up the mind
toward God is an expression of our adoration of God: prayer of
praise and thanksgiving, intercession and petition. Prayer is an
indispensable condition for being able to obey God's commandments. " [We] ought always to pray and not lose heart." 15

2742

2098

Sacrifice
It is right to offer sacrifice to God as a sign of adoration and
gratitude, supplication and communion: "Every action done so as
to cling to God in communion of holiness, and thus achieve blessedness, is a true sacrifice." 16

2099

Outward sacrifice, to be genuine, must be the expression
of spiritual sacrifice: "The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken
spirit. . . . " 1 7 The prophets of the Old Covenant often denounced
sacrifices that were not from the heart or not coupled with love of
neighbor. 18 Jesus recalls the words of the prophet Hosea: " I desire
mercy, and not sacrifice." 19 The only perfect sacrifice is the one that
Christ offered on the cross as a total offering to the Father's love
and for our salvation. 20 By uniting ourselves with his sacrifice we
can make our lives a sacrifice t o God.

Promises and vows

1237 2101
In many circumstances, the Christian is called to make
p romises to God. Baptism and Confirmation, Matrimony and Holy
1 064

Orders always entail promises. Out of personal devotion, the
Christian may also promise to God this action, that prayer, this
alms-giving, that pilgrimage, and so forth. Fidelity to promises
made to God is a sign of the respect owed to the divine majesty and
of love for a faithful God.

"A vow is a deliberate and free promise made to God
concerning a possible and b etter good which must be fulfilled by
reason of the virtue of religion," 21 A vow is an act of devotion in
which the Christian dedicates himself to God or promises him
some good work. By fulfilling his vows he renders to God what has
been promised and consecrated to Him. The Acts of the Apostles
shows us St. Paul concerned to fulfill the vows he had made. 22

2102

The Church recognizes an exemplary value in the vows to
practice the evangelical counsels: 23

1 973 2103

Mother Church rejoices that she has within herself many
men and women who pursue the Savior's self-emptying
more closely and show it forth more clearly, by undertaking
poverty with the freedom of the children of God, and re­
nouncing their own will: they submit themselves to man for
the sake of God, thus going beyond what is of precept in the
ma tter of p erfection, so as to conform themselves more fully
to the obedient Christ. 24

914

The Church can, in certain cases and for proportionate reasons,
dispense from vows and promises. 25

The social duty of religion and the right to religious freedom
"All men are bound to seek the truth, especially in what
concerns God and his Church, and to embrace it and hold on to it
as they come to know it. " 26 This duty derives from "the very
dignity of the human person." 27 It does not contradict a "sincere
respect" for different religions which frequently "reflect a ray of
that truth which enlightens all men," 28 nor the requirement of
charity, which urges Christians "to treat with love, prudence and

patience those who are in error o r ignorance with regard to the
faith." 29

2105
The duty of offering God genuine worship concerns man
both individually and socially. This is "the traditional Catholic
teaching on the moral duty of individuals and societies toward the
true religion and the one Church of Christ." 30 By constantly evan­
gelizing men, the Church works toward enabling them "to infuse
the Christian spirit into the mentality and mores, laws and struc­
tures of the communities in which [they] live. " 31 The social duty of
Christians is to respect and awaken in each man the love of the true
and the good. It requires them to make known the worship of the
one true religion which subsists in the Catholic and apostolic
Church. 32 Christians are called to be the light of the world. Thus,
the Church shows forth the kingship of Christ over all creation and
in particular over human societies. 33
"Nobody may be forced to act against his convictions, nor
is anyone to be restrained from acting in accordance with his
conscience in religious matters in private or in public, alone or in
association with others, within due limits ." 34 This right is based on
the very nature of the human person, whose dignity enables him
freely to assent to the divine truth which transcends the temporal
order. For this reason it "continues to exist even in those who do
not live up to their obligation of seeking the truth and adhering to
it. "35

adhere to error, nor a supposed right to error,37 but rather a natural
right of the human person to civil liberty, i.e., immunity, within

The right to religious liberty can of itself be neither unlimited nor
limited only by a "public order" conceived in a positivist or naturalist
manner. 39 The "due limits" which are inherent in it must be determined

Ill.

"You 5HALL HAVE N0 0THER GODS BEFORE ME"

2110
The first commandment forbids honoring gods other than
the one Lord who has revealed himself to his people. It proscribes
superstition and irreligion. Superstition in some sense represents
a perverse excess of religion; irreligion is the vice contrary by defect
to the virtue of religion.

Superstition
Superstition is the deviation of religious feeling and of the
2111
practices this feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we
offer the true God, e. g., when one attributes an importance in some
way magical to certain practices othenvise lawful or necessary. To
attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their
mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions
that they demand, is to fall into superstition. 41

Idolatry
The first commandment condemns p olytheism. It requires
man neither to believe in, nor to venerate, other divinities than the
2 1 0 one true God. Scripture constantly recalls this rejection of "idols,
[of] silver and gold, the work of men's hands. They have mouths,
but do not speak; eyes, but do not see." These empty idols make
their worshippers empty: "Those who make them are like them; so

are all who trust in them ." 42 God, however, is the "living God" 43
who gives life and intervenes in history.

2113
Idolatry not only refers to false pagan worship. It remains
a constant temptation to faith. Idolatry consists in divinizing what
is not God. Man commits idolatry whenever he honors and reveres
a creature in place of God, whether this be gods or demons (for
example, satanism), power, pleasure, race, ancestors, the state,
money, etc. Jesus says, "You cannot serve God and mammon." 44
Many martyrs died for not adoring "the Beast" 45 refusing even to
simulate such worship . Idolatry rejects the unique Lordship of
God; it is therefore incompatible with communion with God. 46

398, 2534
2289
2473

2114
Human life finds its unity in the adoration of the one God.
The commandment to worship the Lord alone integrates man and
saves him from an endless disintegration. Idolatry is a perversion
of man's innate religious sense. An idolater is someone who "transfers his indestructible notion of God to anything other than God." 47
Divination and magic

2115
God can reveal the future to his prophets or to other saints.
Still, a sound Christian attitude consists in putting oneself confi­
dently into the hands of Providence for whatever concerns the
future, and giving up all unhealthy curiosity about it. Improvi­
dence, however, can constitute a lack of responsibility.
2116
All forms of divination are to be rejected: recourse to Satan
or demons, conjuring up the dead or other practices falsely sup­
posed to "unveil" the future. 48 Consulting horoscopes, astrology,
palm reading, interpretation of omens and lots, the phenomena of
clairvoyance, and recourse to mediums all conceal a desire for
power over time, history,and, in the last analysis, other human
beings, as well as a wish to conciliate hidden powers . They contra­
dict the honor, respect, and loving fear that we owe to God alone .
All practices of magic or sorcery, by which one attempts to
tame occult powers, so as to place them at one's service and have
a supernatural power over others - even if this were for the sake

of restoring their health - are gravely contrary to the virtue of
religion. These practices are even more to be condemned when
accompanied by the intention of harming someone, or when they
have recourse to the intervention of demons. Wearing charms is
also reprehensible. Spiritism often implies divination or magical
practices; the Church for her part warns the faithful against it.
Recourse to so-called traditional cures does not justify either the
invocation of evil powers or the exploitation of another's credulity.
Irreligion

2118
God's first commandment condemns the main sins of
irreligion: tempting God, in words or deeds, sacrilege, and simony.
2119
Tempting God consists in putting his goodness and al394 mighty power to the test by word or deed. Thus Satan tried to

2088

induce Jesus to throw himself down from the Temple and, by this
gesture, force God to act. 49 Jesus opposed Satan with the word of
God: "You shall not put the LORD your God to the test. " 50 The
challenge contained in such tempting of God wounds the respect
and trust we owe our Creator and Lord . It always harbors doubt
about his love, his providence, and his power. 5 1

Sacrilege consists in profaning or treating unworthily the
sacraments and other liturgical actions, as well as persons, things,
or places consecrated to God. Sacrilege is a grave sin especially
when committed against the Eucharist, for in this sacrament the
true Body of Christ is made substantially present for us. 52

2120

1374

Simony is defined as the buying or selling of spiritual
things. 53 To Simon the magician, who wanted to buy the spiritual
power he saw at work in the apostles, St. Peter responded: "Your
silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain
God's gift with money!" 54 Peter thus held to the words of Jesus:
"You received without pay, give without pay."55 It is impossible
to appropriate to oneself spiritual goods and behave toward them
as their owner or master, for they have their source in God. One
can receive them only from him, without payment.

"The minister should ask nothing for the administration of the

always being careful that the needy are not deprived of the help of the
sacraments because of their poverty:• 56 The competent authority deter­
mines these "offerings" in accordance with the principle that the Christian
people ought to contribute to the support of the Church's ministers. "The
laborer deserves his food. '' 57

Atheism
"Many . . . of our contemporaries either do not at all
perceive, or explicitly reject, this intimate and vital bond of man to
God. Atheism must therefore be regarded as one of the most
serious problems of our time. " 58

2123

29

2124
The name "atheism" covers many very different phenom­
ena. One common form is the practical materialism which restricts
its needs and aspirations to space and time. Atheistic humanism
falsely considers man to be "an end to himself, and the sole maker,
with supreme control, of his own history."59 Another form of
contemporary atheism looks for the liberation of man through
economic and social liberation. "It holds that religion, of its very
nature, thwarts such emancipation by raising man's hopes in a
future life, thus both deceiving him and discouraging him from
working for a better form of life on earth." 60
Since it rejects or denies the existence of God, atheism is a
sin against the virtue of religion. 61 The imputability of this offense
can be significantly diminished in virtue of the intentions and the
circumstances. "Believers can have more than a little to do with the
rise of atheism. To the extent that they are careless about their
instruction in the faith, or present its teaching falsely, or even fail
in their religious, moral, or social life, they must be said to conceal
rather than to reveal the true nature of God and of religion." 62

2125

2126
Atheism is often based on a false conception of human
autonomy, exaggerated to the point of refusing any dependence
on God. 63 Yet, "to acknowledge God is in no way to oppose the
dignity of man, since such dignity is grounded and brought to

Agnosticism

36

Agnosticism assumes a number of forms. In certain cases
2127
the agnostic refrains from denying God; instead he postulates the
existence of a transcendent being which is incapable of revealing
itself, and about which nothing can be said. In other cases, the
agnostic makes no judgment about God's existence, declaring it
impossible to prove, or even to affirm or deny.

2128
Agnosticism can sometimes include a certain search for
1 036 G od, but it can equally express indifferentism, a flight from the
ultimate question of existence, and a sluggish moral conscience.
Agnosticism is all too often equivalent to practical atheism.

1 15-1 1 62 IV.

"You SHALL NoT MAKE FOR YOURSELF
A GRAVEN IMAGE • • • "

The divine injunction included the prohibition of every
representation of God by the hand of man. Deuteronomy explains:
"Since you saw no form on the day that the Lord spoke to you at Horeb
out of the midst of the fire, beware lest you act corruptly by making
a graven image for yourselves, in the form of any figure. . . . " 66 It is
the absolutely transcendent God who revealed himself to Israel. "He
is the all," but at the same time "he is greater than all his works. " 67 He
is "the author of beauty." 68

Nevertheless, already in the Old Testament, God ordained
or permitted the making of images that pointed symbolically to­
ward salvation by the incarnate Word: so it was with the bronze
serpent, the ark of the covenant, and the cherubim. 69

2130

Basing itself on the mystery of the incarnate Word, the
seventh ecumenical council at Nicaea (787) justified against the
iconoclasts the veneration of icons - of Christ, but also of the
Mother of God, the angels, and all the saints. By becoming incar­
nate, the Son of God introduced a new "economy" of images.

The Christian veneration of images is not contrary to the
first commandment which proscribes idols. Indeed, "the honor
rendered to an image passes to its prototype," and "whoever
venerates an image venerates the person portrayed in it. "70 The
honor paid to sacred images is a "respectful veneration," not the
adoration due to God alone:
Religious worship is not directed to images in themselves,
considered as mere things, but under their distinctive aspect
as images leading us on to God incarnate. The movement
toward the image does not terminate in it as image, but tends
toward that whose image it is. 71

IN BRIEF

2133

"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart,
and with all your soul and with all your strength"

The first commandment summons man to believe in
God, to hope in him, and to love him above all else.

2135

"You shall worship the Lord your God" (Mt 4:10).
Adoring God, praying to him, offering him the wor­
ship that belongs to him, fulfilling the promises and
vows made to him are acts of the virtue of religion
which fall under obedience to the first commandment.

2136

The duty to offer God authentic worship concerns
man both as an individual and as a social being.

2137

"Men of the present day want to profess their religion
freely in private and in public" (DH 15).

Superstition is a departure from the worship that we
give to the true God. It is manifested in idolatry, as well
as in various forms of divination and magic.

2139

Tempting God in words or deeds, sacrilege, and sim­
ony are sins of irreligion forbidden by the first com­
mandment.

Since it rejects or denies the existence of God, atheism
is a sin against the first commandment.

THE NAME oF THE LoRD Is Hot Y

The second commandment prescribes respect for the Lord's
2142
name. Like the first commandment, it belongs to the virtue of

religion and more particularly it governs our use of speech in
sacred matters.
Among all the words of Revelation, there is one which is
unique: the revealed name of God. God confides his name to those
who believe in him; he reveals himself to them in his personal
mystery. The gift of a name belongs to the order of trust and
intimacy. "The Lord's name is holy." For this reason man must not
abuse it. He must keep it in mind in silent, loving adoration. He
will not introduce it into his own speech except to bless, praise, and
glorify it ? 4

2143

203
435

Respect for his name is an expression of the respect owed
to the mystery of God himself and to the whole sacred reality it
evokes. The sense of the sacred is part of the virtue of religion:

2144

Are these feelings of fear and awe Christian feelings or not? . . .
I say this, then, which I think no one can reasonably dispute.
They are the class of feelings we should have - yes, have to an
intense degree - if we literally had the sight of Almighty God;
therefore they are the class of feelings which we shall have, if
we realize His presence. In proportion as we believe that He is
present, we shall have them; and not to have them, is not to
realize, not to believe that He is present ?5

2147

Promises made to others in God's name engage the divine 2 1 01

honor, fidelity, truthfulness, and authority. They must be respected
in justice. To be unfaithful to them is to misuse God's name and in
some way to make God out to be a liar. 77

2148

Blasphemy is directly opposed to the second command­

ment. It consists in uttering against God - inwardly or outwardly
- words of hatred, reproach, or defiance; in speaking ill of God; in
failing in respect toward him in one's speech; in misusing God's
name. St. James condemns those "who blaspheme that honorable
name [of Jesus] by which you are called." 78 The prohibition of
blasphemy extends to language against Christ's Church, the saints,
and sacred things. It is also blasphemous to make use of God's
name to cover up criminal practices, to reduce peoples to servitude,
to torture persons or put them to death. The misuse of God's name
to commit a crime can provoke others to repudiate religion.
Blasphemy is contrary to the respect due God and his holy
name. It is in itself a grave sin. 79

Oaths which misuse God's name, though without the in­
tention of blasphemy, show lack of respect for the Lord . The second
commandment also forbids magical use of the divine name.

2149

[God's] name is great when spoken with respect for the
greatness of his majesty. God's name is holy when said with
veneration and fear of offending him . 80

TAKING THE NAME OF THE LORD IN VAIN

The second commandment forbids false oaths. Taking an
oath or swearing is to take God as witness to what one affirms. It
is to invoke the divine truthfulness as a pledge of one's own
truthfulness. An oath engages the Lord's name. "You shall fear the
LORD your God; you shall serve him, and swear by his name." 81
2150

215

2476
1 756

2151
Rejection of false oaths is a duty toward God. As Creator
and Lord, God is the norm of all truth. Human speech is either in
accord with or in opposition to God who is Truth itself. When it is
truthful and legitimate, an oath highlights the relationship of hu­
man speech with God's truth. A false oath calls on God to be
witness to a lie.
2152
A person commits perjury when he makes a promise under
oath with no intention of keeping it, or when after promising on
oath he does not keep it. Perjury is a grave lack of respect for the
Lord of all speech. Pledging oneself by oath to commit an evil deed
is contrary to the holiness of the divine name.
2153

2466

In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus explained the second

commandment: "You have heard that it was said to the men of old,
'You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what
you have sworn. ' But I say to you, Do not swear at all . . . . Let what
you say be simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything more than this comes
from the evil one." 82 Jesus teaches that every oath involves a
reference to God and that God's presence and his truth must be
honored in all speech. Discretion in calling upon God is allied with
a respectful awareness of his presence, which all our assertions
either witness to or mock.
Following St. Paul,83 the tradition of the Church has un­
derstood Jesus' words as not excluding oaths made for grave and
right reasons (for example, in court). "An oath, that is the invoca­
tion of the divine name as a witness to truth, cannot be taken unless
in truth, in judgment, and in justice." 84

The holiness of the divine name demands that we neither
use it for trivial matters, nor take an oath which on the basis of the
circumstances could be interpreted as approval of an authority
unjustly requiring it. When an oath is required by illegitimate civil
authorities, it may be refused. It must be refused when it is required
for purposes contrary to the dignity of persons or to ecclesial
communion.

THE CHRISTIAN NAME

III.

2156
The sacrament of Baptism is conferred "in the name of the
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. "85 In Baptism, the
Lord's name sanctifies man, and the Christian receives his name in
the Church. This can be the name of a saint, that is, of a disciple
who has lived a life o f exemplary fidelity to th e Lord . The patron
saint provides a model of charity; we are assured of his intercession. The "baptismal name" can also express a Christian mystery
or Christian virtue. "Parents, sponsors, and the p astor are to see
that a name is not given which is foreign to Christian sentiment ." 86

The Christian begins his day, his prayers, and his activities
with the Sign of the Cross: "in the name of the Father and of the
Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen." The baptized person dedicates
the day to the glory of God and calls on the Savior's grace which
lets him act in the Spirit as a child of the Father. The sign of the
cross strengthens us in temptations and difficulties.

232
1267

2157

God calls each one by name. 87 Everyone's name is sacred.
The name is the icon of the person. It demands respect as a sign of
the dignity of the one who bears it.
2158

2159
The name one receives is a name for eternity. In the king­
dom, the mysterious and unique character of each person marked
with God's name will shine forth in splendor. "To him who con­
quers . I will give a white stone, with a new name written on the
stone which no one knows except h im who receives it." 88 "Then I
looked, and Lo, on Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and with him a
hundred and forty-four thousand who had his name and his
Father's name written on their foreheads." 89

The second commandment enjoins respect for the

The second commandment forbids every improper
use of God's name. Blasphemy is the use of the name
of God, of Jesus Christ, of the Virgin Mary, and of the

False oaths call on God to be witness to a lie. Perjury
is a grave offence against the Lord who is always

Church . Parents, godparents, and the pastor are to see
that he be given a Christian name. The patron saint

THE THIRD COMMANDMENT
Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you
shall labor, and do all your work; but the seventh day is a
sabbath to the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any
work. 90
The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath; so
the Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath.91

THE SABBATH DAY

I.

346-348

The third commandment of the Decalogue recalls the ho­
2168
liness of the sabbath: "The seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest,
holy to the LORD. " 92

2169

In speaking of the sabbath Scripture recalls creation: "For 2057

in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that
is in them, and rested the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed
the sabbath day and hallowed it." 93

2170
Scripture also reveals in the Lord's day a memorial of Israel's
liberation from bondage in Egypt: "You shall remember that you were
a servant in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you
out thence with mighty hand and outstretched arm; therefore the
LORD your God commanded you to keep the sabbath day." 94

2171
God entrusted the sabbath to Israel to keep as a sign of the
irrevocable covenant. 95 The sabbath is for the Lord, holy and set apart

for the praise of God, his work of creation, and his saving actions
on behalf of Israel.

God's action is the model for human action. If God "rested
and was refreshed" on the seventh day, man too ought to "rest"
and should let others, especially the poor, "be refreshed." 96 The
sabbath brings everyday work to a halt and provides a respite. It
is a day of protest against the servitude of work and the worship
of money. 97

The Gospel reports many incidents when Jesus was ac­
cused of violating the sabbath law . But Jesus never fails to respect
the holiness of this day. 98 He gives this law its authentic and
authoritative interpretation: "The sabbath was made for man, not
man for the sabbath."99 With compassion, Christ declares the
sabbath for doing good rather than harm, for saving life rather than
killing. 100 The sabbath is the day of the Lord of mercies and a day
to honor God. 101 "The Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath." 102

·

The day of the Resurrection: the new creation
Jesus rose from the dead "on the first day of the week." 104
Because it is the "first day," the day of Christ's Resurrection recalls
the first creation . Because it is the "eighth day" following the
sabbath , 105 it symbolizes the new creation ushered in by Christ's
Resurrection. For Christians it has become the first of all days, the
first of all feasts, the Lord's Day (he kuriake hemera, dies dominica) ­
Sunday:

We all gather on the day of the sun, for it is the first day [after
the Jewish sabbath, but also the first day] when God, sepa­

same day Jesus Christ our Savior rose from the dead. 106

day fulfills the spiritual truth of the Jewish sabbath and announces
man's eternal rest in God. For worship under the Law prepared for
the mystery of Christ, and what was done there prefigured some
aspects of Christ: 107
Those who lived according to the old order of things have
come to a new hope, no longer keeping the sabbath, but the
Lord's Day, in which our life is blessed by him and by his
death. 108

2176
The celebration of Sunday observes the moral command­
ment inscribed by nature in the human heart to render to God an
outward, visible, public, and regular worship "as a sign of his
universal beneficence to all." 109 Sunday worship fulfills the moral
command of the Old Covenant, taking up its rhythm and spirit in
the weekly celebration of the Creator and Redeemer of his people.

The Sunday Eucharist
2177

The Sunday celebration of the Lord's Day and his Eucharist is at the heart of the Church's life. "Sunday is the day on which
the paschal mystery is celebrated in light of the apostolic tradition
and is to be observed as the foremost holy day of obligation in the
universal Church. '' n o

1 1 67

"Also to be observed are the day of the Nativity of Our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Epiphany, the Ascension of Christ, the feast of the Body and
Blood of Christi, the feast of Mary the Mother of God, her Immaculate
Conception, her Assumption, the feast of Saint Joseph, the feast of the
Apostles Saints Peter and Paul, and the feast of All Saints." 1 1 1

2043

2178
This practice of the Christian assembly dates from the
beginnings of the apostolic age. 112 The Letter to the Hebrews reminds
the faithful "not to neglect to meet together, as is the habit of some,
but to encourage one another." 1 13

Tradition preserves the memory of an ever-timely exhorta­
tion: Come to Church early, app roach the Lord, and confess
your sins, repent in prayer . . . . Be present at the sacred and
divine liturgy, conclude its prayer and do not leave before
the dismissal. . . . We have often said: "This day is given to
you for prayer and rest. This is the day that the Lord has
made, let us rejoice and be glad in it." ll�

"A parish is a definite community of the Christian faithful
established on a stable basis within a particular church; the pastoral
care of the parish is entrusted to a pastor as its own shepherd under
the authority of the diocesan bishop." 1 15 It is the place where all
the faithful can be gathered together for the Sunday celebration of
the Eucharist. The parish initiates the Christian people into the
ordinary expression of the liturgical life: it gathers them together
in this celebration; it teaches Christ's saving doctrine; it practices
the charity of the Lord in good works and brotherly love:

You cannot pray at home as at church, where there is a great
multitude, where exclamations are cried out to God as from
one great heart, and where there is something more: the
union of minds, the accord of souls, the bond of charity, the
prayers of the priests. 116

The Sunday obligation
The precept of the Church specifies the law of the Lord
more precisely: "On Sundays and other holy days of obligation the
faithful are bound to participate in the Mass." 11 7 "The precept of
participating in the Mass is satisfied by assistance at a Mass which
is celebrated anywhere in a Catholic rite either on the holy day or
on the evening of the preceding day." 1 18

The Sunday Eucharist is the foundation and confirmation
of all Christian practice. For this reason the faithful are obliged to
participate in the Eucharist on days of obligation, unless excused
for a serious reason (for example, illness, the care of infants) or
dispensed by their own pastor. 119 Those who deliberately fail in
this obligation commit a grave sin.
2182
Participation in the communal celebration of the Sunday
Eucharist is a testimony of belonging and of being faithful to Christ
and to his Church. The faithful give witness by this to their communion in faith and charity. Together they testify to God's holiness
and their hope of salvation. They strengthen one another under the
guidance of the Holy Spirit.

815

"If because of lack of a sacred minister or for other grave cause
2183
participation in the celebration of the Eucharist is impossible, it is specially
recommended that the faithful take part in the Li turgy of the Word if it is
celebrated in the parish church or in another sacred place according to the
prescrip tions of the diocesan bishop, or engage in prayer for an appropri­
ate amount of time personally or in a family or, as occasion offers, in groups
of families." 120

A day of grace and rest from work
2184
Just as God "rested on the seventh day from all his work
which he had done," 121 human life has a rhythm of work and rest.
The institution of the Lord's Day helps everyone enjoy adequate
rest and leisure to cultivate their familial, cultural, social, and
religious lives. 1 22

On Sundays and other holy days of obligation, the faithful
are to refrain from engaging in work or activities that hinder the
worship owed to God, the joy proper to the Lord's Day, the
performance of the works of mercy, and the appropriate relaxation
of mind and body. 123 Family needs or important social service can
legitimately excuse from the obligation of Sunday rest. The faithful
should see to it that legitimate excuses do not lead to habits
prejudicial to religion, family life, and health.

The charity of truth seeks holy leisure; the necessity of char­
ity accepts just work.124

Those Christians who have leisure should be mindful of
their brethren who have the same needs and the same rights, yet
cannot rest from work because of poverty and misery. Sunday is
traditionally consecrated by Christian piety to good works and
humble service of the sick, the infirm, and the elderly. Christians
will also sanctify Sunday by devoting time and care to their families
and relatives, often difficult to do on other days of the week.
Sunday is a time for reflection, silence, cultivation of the mind, and
meditation which furthers the growth of the Christian interior life.

2186

2447

2187

2289

Sanctifying Sundays and holy days requires a common effort.
Every Christian should avoid making unnecessary demands on others that
would hinder them from observing the Lord's Day. Traditional activities
(sport, restaurants, etc.), and social necessities (public services, etc.), re­
quire some people to work on Sundays, but everyone should still take care
to set aside sufficient time for leisure. With temperance and charity the
faithful will see to it that they avoid the excesses and violence sometimes
associated with popular leisure activities. In spite of economic constraints,
public authorities should ensure citizens a time intended for rest and divine
worship. Employers have a similar obligation toward their employees.

In respecting religious liberty and the common good of all,
Christians should seek recognition of Sundays and the Church's
holy days as legal holidays. They have to give everyone a public
example of prayer, respect, and joy and defend their traditions as
a precious contribution to the spiritual life of society. If a country's
legislation or other reasons require work on Sunday, the day
should nevertheless be lived as the day of our deliverance which
lets us share in this "festal gathering," this "assembly of the first­
born who are enrolled in heaven." 125

"You

Jesus said to his disciples: "Love one another even as I have
1
loved you.''

2196
In response to the question about the first of the command­
ments, Jesus says: "The first is, 'Hear, 0 Israel: The Lord our God,
the Lord is one; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your
heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all
your strength.' The second is this, 'You shall love your neighbor as
yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these." 2

2822

The apostle St. Paul reminds us of this: "He who loves his
neighbor has fulfilled the law. The commandments, 'You shall not

commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not
covet,' and any other commandment, are summed up in this sen­
tence, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' Love does no
wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. "3

Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be

parents in the Lord, for this is right. 'Honor your father and

'that it may: be well with you and that you may live long on

The fourth commandment opens the second table of the
Decalogue. It shows us the order of charity. God has willed that,
after him, we should honor our parents to whom we owe life and
who have handed on to us the knowledge of God. We are obliged
to honor and respect all those whom God, for our good, has vested
with his authority.
This commandment is expressed in positive terms of duties to be fulfilled. It introduces the subsequent commandments
which are concerned with particular respect for life, marriage,
earthly goods, and speech. It constitutes one of the foundations of
the social doctrine of the Church.

1 897

2198

The fourth commandment is addressed expressly to chil­
dren in their relationship to their father and mother, because this
relationship is the most universal. It likewise concerns the ties of
kinship between members of the extended family. It requires
honor, affection, and gratitude toward elders and ancestors. Fi­
nally, it extends to the duties of pupils to teachers, employees to
employers, subordinates to leaders, citizens to their country, and
to those who administer or govern it.
This commandment includes and presupposes the duties
of parents, instructors, teachers, leaders, magistrates, those who
govern, all who exercise authority over others or over a community
of persons.

2199

2200
Observing the fourth commandment brings its reward:
"Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long
in the land which the LORD your God gives you ." 8 Respecting this
commandment provides, along with spiritual fruits, temporal
fruits of peace and prosperity. Conversely, failure to observe it
brings great harm to communities and to individuals.

THE FAMILY I N GOD'S PLAN

I.

The nature of the family
The conjugal community is established upon the consent
of the spouses. Marriage and the family are ordered to the good of
the spouses and to the procreation and education of children. The
love of the spouses and the begetting of children create among

2201

532

members of the same family personal relationships and primordial
responsibilities.
A man and a woman united in marriage, together with
their children, form a family. This institution is prior to any recog­
nition by public authority, which has an obligation to recognize it.
It should be considered the normal reference point by which the
different forms of family relationship are to be evaluated.

1 882 2202

In creating man and woman, God instituted the human
family and endowed it with its fundamental constitution. Its mem­
bers are persons equal in dignity. For the common good of its
members and of society, the family necessarily has manifold re­
sponsibilities, rights, and duties.

1 655-1 658 The Christian fam ily
2204
"The Christian family constitutes a specific revelation and
realization of ecclesial communion, and for this reason it can and
533 should be called a domestic church."9 It is a community of faith,
hope, and charity; it assumes singular importance in the Church,
as is evident in the New Testament.IO
The Christian family is a communion of persons, a sign
and image of the communion of the Father and the Son in the Holy
Spirit. In the procreation and education of children it reflects the
Father's work of creation. It is called to partake of the prayer and
sacrifice of Christ. Daily prayer and the reading of the Word of God
strengthen it in charity. The Christian family has an evangelizing
and missionary task.

1 702 2205

2206
The relationships within the family bring an affinity of
feelings, affections and interests, arising above all from the mem­
bers' respect for one another. The family is a privileged community
called to achieve a "sharing of thought and common deliberation
by the spouses as well as their eager cooperation as parents in the
children's upbringing." l l

THE FAMILY AND SOCIETY

2207
The family is the original cell of social life. It is the natural 1 880
society in which husband and wife are called to give themselves in
love and in the gift of life. Authority, stability, and a life of relationships within the family constitute the foundations for freedom, 372
security, and fraternity within society. The family is the commu- 1 603
nity in which, from childhood, one can learn moral values, begin
to honor God, and make good use of freedom. Family life is an
initiation into life in society.
2208
The family should live in such a way that its members learn
to care and take responsibility for the young, the old, the sick, the
handicapped, and the poor. There are many families who are at
times incapable of providing this help. It devolves then on other
persons, other families, and, in a subsidiary way, society to provide
for their needs: "Religion that is pure and undefiled before God
and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction
and to keep oneself unstained from the world." 12
2209
The family must be helped and defended by appropriate
social measures. Where families cannot fulfill their responsibilities,
other social bodies have the duty of helping them and of supporting the institution of the family. Following the principle of sub­
sidiarity, larger communities should take care not to usurp the 1 883
family's prerogatives or interfere in its life.
2210
The importance of the family for the life and well-being of
society13 entails a particular responsibility for society to support
and strengthen marriage and the family. Civil authority should
consider it a grave duty "to acknowledge the true nature of mar­
riage and the family, to protect and foster them, to safeguard public
morality, and promote domestic prosperity." 14
2211
The political community has a duty to honor the family, to assist
it, and to ensure especially:
- the freedom to establish a family, have children, and bring them up in
keeping with the family's own moral and religious convictions;
- the protection of the stability of the marriage bond and the institution of
the family;
- the freedom to profess one's faith, to hand it on, and raise one's children
in it, with the necessary means and institutions;

- the right to private property, to free enterprise, to obtain work and
housing, and the right to emigrate;
- in keeping with the country's institutions, the right to medical care,
assistance for the aged, and family benefits;
- the protection of security and health, especially with respect to dangers
like drugs, pornography, alcoholism, etc.;
- the freedom to form associations with other families and so to have
representation before civil authority .I S

2212
The fourth commandment illuminates other relationships in
society. In our brothers and sisters we see the children of our
parents; in our cousins, the descendants of our ancestors; in our
fellow citizens, the children of our country; in the baptized, the
children of our mother the Church; in every human person, a son
225 or daughter of the One who wants to be called "our Father." In this
way our relationships with our neighbors are recognized as per­
sonal in character. The neighbor is not a "unit" in the human
1 93 1 collective; he is "someone" who by his known origins deserves
particular attention and respect.
2213
Human communities are made up of persons. Governing
them well is not limited to guaranteeing rights and fulfilling duties
such as honoring contracts. Right relations between employers and
employees, between those who govern and citizens, presuppose a
natural good will in keeping with the dignity of human persons
1 93 9 concerned for justice and fraternity.

THE DUTIES OF fAMILY MEMBERS

The duties

of children

2214
The divine fatherhood is the source of human father­
hood; 16 this is the foundation of the honor owed to parents. The
respect of children, whether minors or adults, for their father and
mother1 7 is nourished by the natural affection born of the bond
1 858 uniting them. It is required by God's commandment. 1 8
221 5
Respect for parents (filial piety) derives from gratitude to­
ward those who, by the gift of life, their love and their work, have
brought their children into the world and enabled them to grow in

stature, wisdom, and grace. "With all your heart honor your father,
and do not forget the birth pangs of your mother. Remember that
through your parents you were born; what can you give back to
them that equals their gift to you?" 19

2216
Filial respect is shown by true docility and obedience. "My 532
son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your
mother's teaching . . . . When you walk, they will lead you; when
you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they
will talk with you." 20 "A wise son hears his father's instruction, but
a scoffer does not listen to rebuke. " 21
2217
As long as a child lives at home with his parents, the child should
obey his parents in all that they ask of him when it is for his good or that
of the family. "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases
the Lord."22 Children should also obey the reasonable directions of their
teachers and all to whom their parents have entrusted them. But if a child
is convinced in conscience that it would be morally wrong to obey a
particular order, he must not do so.
As they grow up, children should continue to respect their par­
ents. They should anticipate their wishes, willingly seek their advice, and
accept their j ust admonitions. Obedience toward parents ceases with the
emancipation of the children; not so respect, which is always owed to them.
This respect has its roots in the fear of God, one of the gifts of the Holy
1 831
Spirit.

2218
The fourth commandment reminds grown children of
their responsibilities toward their parents. As much as they can, they
must give them material and moral support in old age and in times
of illness, loneliness, or distress. Jesus recalls this duty of grati­
tude. 23
For the Lord honored the father above the children, and he
confirmed the right of the mother over her sons. Whoever
honors his father atones for sins, and whoever glorifies his
mother is like one who lays up treasure. Whoever honors his
father will be gladdened by his own children, and when he
prays he will be heard. Whoever glorifies his father will have
long life, and whoever obeys the Lord will refresh his
mother. 24

0 son, help your father in his old age, and do not grieve him as
long as he lives; even if he is lacking in understanding, show
forbearance; in all your strength do not despise him . Who­
ever forsakes his father is like a blasphemer, and whoever
angers his mother is cursed by the Lord . 25
. .

.

Filial respect promotes harmony in all of family life; it also
concerns relationships between brothers and sisters. Respect toward
parents fills the home with light and warmth. "Grandchildren are
the crown of the aged. "26 "With all humility and meekness, with
patience, [support] one another in charity." 27
2219

2220
For Christians a special gratitude is due to those from
whom they have received the gift of faith, the grace of Baptism, and
life in the Church. These may include parents, grandparents, other
members of the family, pastors, catechists, and other teachers or
friends. "I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first
in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am
sure, dwells in you." 28

The duties

of parents

2221
The fecundity of conjugal love cannot be reduced solely to
the procreation of children, but must extend to their moral educa­
tion and their spiritual formation. "The role of parents in education
1 653 is of such importance that it is almost impossible to provide an
adequate substitute." 29 The right and the duty of parents to edu­
cate their children are primordial and inalienable. 30

Parents must regard their children as children of God and
respect them as human persons. Showing themselves obedient to the
494 will of the Father in heaven, they educate their children to fulfill
God's law.

2223
Parents have the first responsibility for the education of
their children. They bear witness to this responsibility first by
creating a home where tenderness, forgiveness, respect, fidelity, and
disinterested service are the rule. The home is well suited for
education in the virtues. This requires an apprenticeship in self-denial, sound judgment, and self-mastery - the preconditions of all 1 804
true freedom. Parents should teach their children to subordinate
the "material and instinctual dimensions to interior and spiritual
ones." 31 Parents have a grave responsibility to give good example
to their children. By knowing how to acknowledge their own
failings to their children, parents will be better able to guide and
correct them:
He who loves his son will not spare the rod . . . . He who
disciplines his son will profit by him. 32
Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring
them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. 33

2224
The home is the natural environment for initiating a hu- 1 939
man being into solidarity and communal responsibilities. Parents
should teach children to avoid the compromising and degrading
influences which threaten human societies.
2225
Through the grace of the sacrament of marriage, parents
receive the responsibility and privilege of evangelizing their children.
Parents should initiate their children at an early age into the 1 656
mysteries of the faith of which they are the "first heralds" for their
children. They should associate them from their tenderest years
with the life of the Church. 34 A wholesome family life can foster
interior dispositions that are a genuine preparation for a living faith
and remain a support for it throughout one's life.
2226
Education in the faith by the parents should begin in the
child's earliest years. This already happens when family members
help one another to grow in faith by the witness of a Christian life
in keeping with the Gospel. Family catechesis precedes, accompa­
nies, and enriches other forms of instruction in the faith. Parents
have the mission of teaching their children to pray and to discover
their vocation as children of God. 35 The parish is the Eucharistic 2 1 79

commtmity and the heart of the liturgical life of Christian families;
it is a privileged place for the catechesis of children and parents.
Children in tum contribute to the growth in holiness of their
parents.36 Each and everyone should be generous and tireless in
forgiving one another for offenses, quarrels, injustices, and neglect.
Mutual affection suggests this. The charity of Christ demands it. 37

201 3 2227

2228
Parents' respect and affection are expressed by the care
and attention they devote to bringing up their yormg children and
providing for their physical and spiritual needs. As the children grow
up, the same respect and devotion lead parents to educate them in
the right use of their reason and freedom.
2229
As those first responsible for the education of their chil­
dren, parents have the right to choose a school for them which
corresponds to their own convictions. This right is ftmdamental.
As far as possible parents have the duty of choosing schools that
will best help them in their task as Christian educators. 38 Public
authorities have the duty of guaranteeing this parental right and
of ensuring the concrete conditions for its exercise.
2230
When they become adults, children have the right and
duty to choose their profession and state of life. They should assume
their new responsibilities within a trusting relationship with their
parents, willingly asking and receiving their advice and cormsel.
Parents should be careful not to exert pressure on their children
1 625 either in the choice of a profession or in that of a spouse. This
necessary restraint does not prevent them - quite the contrary ­
from giving their children judicious advice, particularly when they
are planning to start a family.
2231
Some forgo marriage in order to care for their parents or
brothers and sisters, to give themselves more completely to a
profession, or to serve other honorable ends. They can contribute
greatly to the good of the human family.

THE fAMILY AND THE KINGDOM

2232
Family ties are important but not absolute. Just as the child
grows to maturity and human and spiritual autonomy, so his
unique vocation which comes from God asserts itself more clearly
and forcefully. Parents should respect this call and encourage their
children to follow it. They must be convinced that the first vocation
of the Christian is to follow Jesus: "He who loves father or mother 1 61 8
more than me is not worthy o f me; and he who loves son or
daughter more than me is not worthy of me. "39
2233
Becoming a disciple of Jesus means accepting the invita­
tion to belong to God's family, to live in conformity with His way of
life: "For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my 542
brother, and sister, and mother." 40
Parents should welcome and respect with joy and thanks­
giving the Lord's call to one of their children to follow him in
virginity for the sake of the Kingdom in the consecrated life or in
priestly ministry.

V.

THE AUTHORITIES IN CIVIL SOCIETY

2234
God's fourth commandment also enjoins us to honor all
who for our good have received authority in society from God. It
clarifies the duties of those who exercise authority as well as those 1 897
who benefit from it.
Duties of civil authorities
2235
Those who exercise authority should do so as a service.
"Whoever would be great among you must be your servant." 41 The
exercise of authority is measured morally in terms of its divine
origin, its reasonable nature and its specific object. No one can
command or establish what is contrary to the dignity of persons 1 899
and the natural law.
2236
The exercise of authority is meant to give outward expression to a just hierarchy of values in order to facilitate the exercise
of freedom and responsibility by all. Those in authority should
practice distributive justice wisely, taking account of the needs and 241 1

contribution of each, with a view to harmony and peace. They
should take care that the regulations and measures they adopt are
not a source of temptation by setting personal interest against that
of the community. 42

2237
Political authorities are obliged to respect the fundamental
rights of the human person. They will dispense justice humanely
357 by respecting the rights of everyone, especially of families and the
disadvantaged.
The political rights attached to citizenship can and should
be granted according to the requirements of the common good.
They cannot be suspended by public authorities without legitimate
and proportionate reasons. Political rights are meant to be exercised
for the common good of the nation and the human community.

The duties of

citizens

2238
Those subject to authority should regard those in authority
as representatives of God, who has made them stewards of his gifts:43
1 900 "Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution. . . . Live as
free men, yet without using your freedom as a pretext for evil; but live
as servants of God. " 44 Their loyal collaboration includes the right, and
at times the duty, to voice their just criticisms of that which seems
harmful to the dignity of persons and to the good of the community.
It is the duty of citizens to contribute along with the civil
authorities to the good of society in a spirit of truth, justice, solidar­
ity, and freedom. The love and service of one's country follow from
231 0 the duty of gratitude and belong to the order of charity. Submission
to legitimate authorities and service of the common good require
citizens to fulfill their roles in the life of the political community.

1 915 2239

2240
Submission to authority and co-responsibility for the com­
mon good make it morally obligatory to pay taxes, to exercise the
2265 right to vote, and to defend one's country:
Pay to all of them their dues, taxes to whom taxes are due,
revenue to whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect
is due, honor to whom honor is due. 45

[Christians] reside in their own nations, but as resident
aliens. They participate in all things as citizens and endure
all things as foreigners. . . . They obey the established laws
and their way of life surpasses the laws . . . . So noble is the
position to which God has assigned them that they are not
allowed to desert it. 46
The Apostle exhorts us to offer prayers and thanksgiving for
kings and all who exercise authority, "that we may lead a quiet and
peaceable life, godly and respectful in every way." 47

1 900

2241
The more prosperous nations are obliged, to the extent
they are able, to welcome theforeigner in search of the security and
the means of livelihood which he cannot find in his country of
origin. Public authorities should see to it that the natural right is
respected that places a guest under the protection of those who
receive him.
Political authorities, for the sake of the common good for which
they are responsible, may make the exercise of the right to immigrate
subject to various juridical conditions, especially with regard to the immi­
grants' duties toward their country of adoption. Immigrants are obliged
to respect with gratitude the material and spiritual heritage of the country
that receives them, to obey its laws and to assist in carrying civic burdens.

2242
The citizen is obliged in conscience not to follow the direc­
tives of civil authorities when they are contrary to the demands of
the moral order, to the fundamental rights of persons or the teach- 1 903
ings of the Gospel. Refusing obedience to civil authorities, when their 2313
demands are contrary to those of an upright conscience, finds its
justification in the distinction between serving God and serving the
political community. "Render therefore to Caesar the things that 450
are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." 48 "We must
obey God rather than men" :49
When citizens are under the oppression of a public authority
which oversteps i ts competence, they should still not refuse
to give or to do what is objectively demanded of them by the
common good; but it is legitimate for them to defend their
own rights and those of their fellow citizens against the
abuse of this authority within the limits of the natural law
and the Law of the Gospel.SO

Armed resistance to oppression by political authority is not
legitimate, unless all the following conditions are met: 1) there is
certain, grave, and prolonged violation of fundamental rights; 2)
all other means of redress have been exhausted; 3) such resistance
will not provoke worse disorders; 4) there is well-founded hope of
success; and 5) it is impossible reasonably to foresee any better
solution.

2309 2243

The political community and the Church
Every institution is inspired, at least implicitly, by a vision
of man and his destiny, from which it derives the point of reference
for its judgment, its hierarchy of values, its line of conduct. Most
societies have formed their institutions in the recognition of a
certain preeminence of man over things. Only the divinely re1 881 vealed religion has clearly recognized man's origin and destiny in
God, the Creator and Redeemer. The Church invites political
2109 authorities to measure their judgments and decisions against this
inspired truth about God and man:

1910 2244

Societies not recognizing this vision or rejecting it in the
name of their independence from God are brought to seek
their criteria and goal in themselves or to borrow them from
some ideology. Since they do not admit that one can defend
an objective criterion of good and evil, they arrogate to
themselves an explicit or implicit totalitarian power over
man and his destiny, as history shows.51

2245
The Church, because of her commission and competence,
is not to be confused in any way with the political community. She
912 is both the sign and the safeguard of the transcendent character of
the human person. "The Church respects and encourages the
political freedom and responsibility of the citizen."52
2246
It is a part of the Church's mission "to pass moral judg­
ments even in matters related to politics, whenever the fundamen2032 tal rights of man or the salvation of souls requires it. The means,
2420 the only means, she may use are those which are in accord with the
Gospel and the welfare of all men according to the diversity of
times and circumstances."53

Parents have the first responsibility for the education

They have the duty to provide as far as possible for the

It is the duty of citizens to work with civil authority

Citizens are obliged in conscience not to follow the

to the demands of the moral order. "We must obey
God rather than men" (Acts 5:29).

The witness of sacred history
In the account of Abel's murder by his brother Cain,57
Scripture reveals the presence of anger and envy in man, conse­
quences of original sin, from the beginning of human history. Man
has become the enemy of his fellow man. God declares the wick­
edness of this fratricide: "What have you done? The voice of your
brother's blood is crying to me from the ground. And now you are
cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive
your brother's blood from your hand."58

The Old Testament always considered blood a sacred sign

of life . 60 This teaching remains necessary for all time.

2261

Scrip ture specifies the prohib ition contained in the fifth

com mandment: "Do not slay the innocent and the righteous." 6 1

The deliberate murder of an innocent person is gravely contrary to

the dignity of the human being, to the golden rule, and to the

holiness of the Creator. The law forbid ding it is universally vali d :

1 756
1 956

it obliges each and everyone, always and everywhere.

2262

In the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord recalls the com­

mandment, "You shall not kill,"62 and adds to it the proscription

of anger, hatred, and vengeance. Going further, Chris t asks his
disciples to turn the other cheek, to love their enemies. 63 He did not
defend himself and told Peter to leave his sword in its sheath. 64

2844

Legitimate defense
2263

The legitimate defense of persons and societies is not an

excep tion to the prohibition against the murder of the innocent that

constitutes intentional killing. "The act of self-defense can have a

double effect: the preservation of one 's own life; and the killing of
the aggressor . . . . The one is intended, the other is not." 65

1 737

Love toward oneself remains a fund amental p rinciple of

2196

2264

morality. Therefore it is legitimate to insist on respect for one's own
right to life. Someone who defends his life is not guilty of murder

even if he is forced to deal his aggressor a lethal blow:

If a man in self-defense uses more than necessary violence,
it will be unlawful: whereas if he repels force with modera­
tion, his defense will be lawful. . . . Nor is it necessary for
salvation that a man omit the act of moderate self-defense to
avoid killing the other man, since one is bound to take more
care of one's own life than of another's. 66

2265

Legitimate defense can be not only a right but a grave duty

for one who is responsible for the lives of others . The defense of
the common good requires that an unjust aggressor be rendered

unable to cause harm. For this reason, those who legi timately hold

au thori ty also have the right to use arms to repel aggressors agains t
the civil community entrusted to their responsib ility.

2266

The efforts of the state to curb the spread of behavior

harmful to people's rights and to the basic rules of civil society
1 897-1 898

correspond to the requirement of safeguarding the common good .

Legitimate public authority has the right and the duty to inflict

punishment proportionate to the gravity of the offense. Punish­

ment has the primary aim of redressing the disorder introduced by
the offense . When it is willingly accepted by the guilty party, it

2308

assumes the value of exp iation. Punishment then, in addition to

defending public order and protecting people's safety, has a medici­

nal purpose : as far as possible, it must contribute to the correction
of the guilty party. 67

2267
2306

Assuming that the guilty party's identity and responsibil­

ity have been fully determined, the traditional teaching of the

Church does not exclude recourse to the death penalty, if this is the
only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the

unjust aggressor.

If, however, non-lethal means are sufficient to defend and
protect people's safety from the aggressor, authority will limit itself

to such means, as these are more in keeping with the concrete

conditions of the common good and more in conformity with the
dignity of the human person.

Today, in fact, as a consequence of the possibilities which

the state has for effectively preventing crime, by rendering one who

has committed an offense incapable of doing harm - without

definitively taking away from him the possibility of redeeming
himself - the cases in which the execution of the offender is an
absolute necessity " are very rare, if not practically non-existent. "68

Intentional homicide
2268

The fifth commandment forbids direct and inten tional killing

as gravely sinfu l. The murderer and those who cooperate volun­

tarily in murder commit a sin that cries out to heaven for venge-

ance. 69

1 867

Infanticide, 70 fratricide, parricide, and the murder of a spouse
are especially grave crimes by reason of the natural bonds which they
break. Concern for eugenics or public health cannot justify any murder,
even if commanded by public authority.

2269

The fifth commandment forbids doing anything with the

intention of

indirectly bringing about

a person's death. The moral

law prohibits exposing someone to mortal danger without grave

reason, as well as refusing assistance to a person

in danger .

The acceptance by human society of murderous famines, without
efforts to remedy them, is a scandalous injustice and a grave offense. Those
whose usurious and avaricious dealings lead to the hunger and death of
their brethren in the human family indirectly commit homicide, which is
imputable to them. 71

Unin ten tional

killing is not morally impu table. But one is

2290

not exonerated from grave offense if, without proportionate rea-

sons, he has acted in a way that brings about someone's death, even
without the intention to do so.

Abortion
2270

Human life must be respected and protected absolutely

from the moment of conception. From the first m oment of his

existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights
of a person - among which is the inviolable right of every innocent

being to life.72

Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before
you were born I consecrated you ?3
My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made
in secret, intricately wrought in the depths of the earth ?4

Part Three
Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral

evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and

remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, tha t is to say, abortion

willed either as an end or a means, is gravely con trary to the m oral

law :

You shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause
the newborn to perish ?S
God, the Lord of life, has entrusted to men the noble mission
of safeguarding life, and men must carry it out in a manner
worthy of themselves. Life must be protected with the ut­
most care from the moment of conception: abortion and
infanticide are abominable crirnes ?6

2272

Formal cooperation

in

an abortion constitutes a grave

offense. The Church attaches the canonical penalty of excommuni­

cation to this crime against human life. "A person who procures a

completed abortion incurs excommunication latae sententiae, "77
"by the very commission of the offense,"78 and subject to the

1463 conditions provided by Canon Law ?9 The Church does not thereby
intend to restrict the scope of mercy. Rather, she makes clear the

gravity of the crime committed, the irreparable harm done to the
innocent who is put to death, as well as to the parents and the whole

of society.

1 930

2273

The inalienable right to life of every innocent human indi-

vidual is a

constitutive element of a civil society and its legislation:

"The inalienable rights of the person must be recognized and
respected by civil society and the political authority. These human rights
depend neither on single individuals nor on parents; nor do they represent
a concession made by society and the state; they belong to human nature
and are inherent in the person by virtue of the creative act from which the
person took his origin. Among such fundamental rights one should men­
tion in this regard every human being's right to life and physical integrity
from the moment of conception until death." 80
"The moment a positive law deprives a category of human beings
of the protection which civil legislation ought to accord them, the state is
denying the equality of all before the law. When the state does not place
its power at the service of the rights of each citizen, and in particular of the
more vulnerable, the very foundations of a state based on law are under­
mined . . . . As a consequence of the respect and protection which must be

ensured for the unborn child from the moment of conception, the law must
provide appropriate penal sanctions for every deliberate violation of the
child's rights."81

2274

Since it must be treated from conception as a person, the

embryo must be defended

in its integrity,

cared for, and healed, as

far as possible, like any other human being.

Prenatal diagnosis is morally licit, "if it respects the life and integ­
rity of the embryo and the human fetus and is directed toward its safe­
guarding or healing as an individual. . . . It is gravely opposed to the moral
law when this is done with the thought of possibly inducing an abortion,
depending upon the results: a diagnosis must not be the equivalent of a
death sentence.''82

2275
"One must hold as licit procedures carried out on the human
embryo which respect the life and integrity of the embryo and do not
involve disproportionate risks for it, but are directed toward its healing,
the improvement of its condition of health, or its individual survival." 83"
"It is immoral to produce human embryos intended for exploi­
tation as disposable biological materiaJ." 84
"Certain attempts to influence chromosomic or genetic inheritance
are not therapeutic but are aimed at producing human beings selected
according to sex or other predetermined qualities. Such manipulations are
contrary to the personal dignity of the human being and his integrity and
identity" 85 which are unique and unrepeatable.

Euthanasia
2276

Those whose lives are diminished or weakened deserve

special respect. Sick or handicapped persons should be helped to
lead lives as normal as possible.

2277

Whatever its motives and means, direct euthanasia con­

sists in pu tting an end to the lives of handicapped, sick, or dying
persons . It is morally unacceptable.

Thus an act or omission which, of itself or by intention, causes
death in order to eliminate suffering constitutes a murder gravely contrary
to the dignity of the human person and to the respect due to the living
God, his Creator. The error of judgment into which one can fall in good
faith does not change the nature of this murderous act, which must always
be forbidden and excluded.

Discontinuing medical procedu res tha t are burdensome, danger­
ous, extraordinary, or disproportionate to the expected ou tcome can be
legitima te; it is the refusal of "over-zealous" treatmen t. Here one does not
will to cause death; one's inability to impede it is merely accepted . The
1 007 decisions should be made by the patient if he is competent and able or, if
not, by those legally entitled to act for the patient, whose reasonable will
and legitimate interests must always be respected.
2279

Even if death is thought imminent, the ordinary care owed to a
sick person cannot be legitimately interru pted.The use of painkillers to
alleviate the sufferings of the dying, even at the risk of shortening their
days, can be morally in conformity with human dignity if death is not
willed as either an end or a means, but only foreseen and tolerated as
inevitable.Palliative care is a special form of disinterested charity. As such
it should be encouraged.

Suicide
2280

Everyone is responsible for his life before God who has

given it to him . It is God who remains the sovereign Master of life.

2258

We are obliged to accept life gratefully and preserve it for his honor

and the salvation of our souls. We are stewards, not owners, of the

life God has entrusted to us. It is not ours to dispose of.

2281

Suicide contradicts the natural inclination of the human

being to preserve and perpetuate his life . It is gravely contrary to

the just love of self. It likewise offends love of neighbor because it

2212

unjus tly breaks the ties of solidarity with family, nation, and other

human societies to which we continue to have obligations . Suicide
is contrary to love for the living God.

2282

If suicide is committed with the intention of setting an

example, especially to the young, it also takes on the gravity of

1 735

scandal. Voluntary co-operation in suicide is contrary to the moral
law.

Grave psychological disturbances, anguish, or grave fear

of hardship, suffering, or torture can d iminish the responsibility of

the one committing suicide.

2283

We should not despair of the eternal salvation of persons

who have taken their own lives . By ways known to him alone, God

can provide the opportunity for salutary repentance. The Church

1 03 7 prays for persons who have taken their own lives.

RESPECf FOR THE DIGNITY OF PERSONS

Respect for the souls of others: scandal

2284

Scandal is an attitude or behavior which leads another to

do evi l. The person who gives scandal becomes his neighbor's

2847

tempter. He damages virtue and integrity; he may even draw his

brother into spiritual death. Scandal is a grave offense if by deed
or omission another is deliberately led into a grave offense.

2285

Scandal takes on a particular gravity by reason of the

1 903

authority of those who cause it or the weakness of those who are

scandalized .

It promp ted our Lord

to utter this curse: "Whoever

causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would b e

better for him t o have a great mills tone fastened round his neck and
to be drowned in the depth of the sea." 86 Scandal is grave when
given by those who by nature or office are obliged to teach and

educate others. Jesus reproaches the scribes and Pharisees on this
account: he likens them to wolves in sheep's clothingP

2286

Scandal can be provoked by laws or institutions, by fash­

ion or opinion.

Therefore, they are guilty of scandal who establish laws or social
structures leading to the decline of morals and the corruption of religious
practice, or to "social conditions that, intentionally or not, make Christian
conduct and obedience to the Commandments difficult and practically
impossible." 88 This is also true of business leaders who make rules encouraging fraud, teachers who provoke their children to anger,89 or manipulators of public opinion who tum it away from moral values.

2287

1 887

2498

Anyone who uses the power at his disposal in such a way

that it leads others to do wrong becomes guilty of scandal and

responsible for the evil that he has directly or indirectly encour­

aged. "Temptations to sin are sure to come; but woe to him by
whom they come ! " 9 0

Concern for the health of its citizens requires tha t society help
in the attainment of living-conditions that allow them to grow and
reach maturity: food and clothing, housing, health care, basic edu­
cation, employment, and social assistance.

364

2289
If morality requires respect for the life of the body, it does
not make it an absolute value. It rejects a neo-pagan notion that
tends to promote the cult of the body, to sacrifice everything for its
sake, to idolize physical perfection and success at sports. By its
selective preference of the strong over the weak, such a conception
can lead to the perversion of human relationships.

2113

1 809

The virtue of temperance disposes us to avoid every kind of
excess: the abuse of food, alcohol, tobacco, or medicine. Those incur
grave guilt who, by drunkenness or a love of speed, endanger their
own and others' safety on the road, at sea, or in the air.
2290

2291
The use of drugs inflicts very grave damage on human
health and life. Their use, except on strictly therapeutic grounds, is
a grave offense. Clandestine production of and trafficking in drugs
are scandalous practices. They constitute direct co-operation in
evil, since they encourage people to practices gravely contrary to
the moral law.

Respect for the person and scientific research
2292
Scientific, medical, or psychological experiments on hu­
man individuals or groups can contribute to healing the sick and
the advancement of public health.
159

2293
Basic scientific research, as well as applied research, is a significant expression of man's dominion over creation. Science and technology
are precious resources when placed at the service of man and promote his
integral development for the benefit of all. By themselves however they
cannot disclose the meaning of existence and of human progress. Science
and technology are ordered to man, from whom they take their origin and
development; hence they find in the person and in his moral values both
1 703 evidence of their purpose and awareness of their limits.
2294

It is an illusion to claim moral neutrality in scientific research and
its applications. On the other hand, guiding principles cannot be inferred
from simple technical efficiency, or from the usefulness accruing to some
at the expense of others or, even worse, from prevailing ideologies. Science
and technology by their very nature require unconditional respect for
2375 fundamental moral criteria. They must be at the service of the human
person, of his inalienable rights, of his true and integral good, in conform­
ity with the plan and the will of God.

Life in Christ

553

2295
Research or experimentation on the human being cannot
legitimate acts that are in themselves contrary to the dignity of 1 753
persons and to the moral law. The subjects' potential consent does
not justify such acts. Experimentation on human beings is not
morally legitimate if it exposes the subject's life or physical and
psychological integrity to disproportionate or avoidable risks. Ex­
perimentation on human beings does not conform to the dignity of
the person if it takes place without the informed consent of the
subject or those who legitimately speak for him.
Organ transplants are in conformity with the moral law if the 2301
physical and psychological dangers and risks to the donor are proportionate to the good that is sought for the recipient. Organ donation after death
is a noble and meritorous act and is to be encouraged as an expression of
generous solidarity. It is not morally acceptable if the donor or his proxy
has not given explicit consent. Moreover, it is not morally admissible
directly to bring about the disabling mutilation or death of a human being,
even in order to delay the death of other persons.

2296

Respect for bodily integrity
2297
Kidnapping and hostage taking bring on a reign of terror; by
means of threats they subject their victims to intolerable pressures.
They are morally wrong. Terrorism threatens, wounds, and kills
indiscriminately; it is gravely against justice and charity. Torture
which uses physical or moral violence to extract confessions, pun­
ish the guilty, frighten opponents, or satisfy hatred is contrary to
respect for the person and for human dignity. Except when per­
formed for strictly therapeutic medical reasons, directly intended
amputations, mutilations, and sterilizations performed on innocent
persons are against the moral law. 91
2298

In times past, cruel practices were commonly used by legitimate
governments to maintain law and order, often without protest from the
Pastors of the Church, who themselves adopted in their own tribunals the
prescriptions of Roman law concerning torture. Regrettable as these facts
are, the Church always taught the duty of clemency and mercy. She
forbade clerics to shed blood. In recent times it has become evident that 2267
these cruel practices were neither necessary for public order, nor in con­
formity with the legitimate rights of the human person. On the contrary,
these practices led to ones even more degrading. It is necessary to work
for their abolition. We must pray for the victims and their tormentors.

The bodies of the dead must be treated with respect and

is a corporal work of mercy;92 it honors the children of God, who
are temples of the Holy Spirit.

Autopsies can be morally permitted for legal inquests or scientific
research. The free gift of organs after death is legitimate and can be
meritorious.
The Church permits cremation, provided that it does not dem­

SAFEGUARDING PEACE

Peace
2302
By recalling the commandment, "You shall not ki11,"94 our
Lord asked for peace of heart and denounced murderous anger and
1 765 hatred as immoral.
Anger is a desire for revenge. "To desire vengeance in order
to do evil to someone who should be punished is illicit," but it is
praiseworthy to impose restitution "to correct vices and maintain
justice."95 If anger reaches the point of a deliberate desire to kill or
seriously wound a neighbor, it is gravely against charity; it is a
mortal sin. The Lord says, "Everyone who is angry with his brother
shall be liable to judgment."96

2094 2303

Deliberate hatred is contrary to charity. Hatred of the neighbor
is a sin when one deliberately wishes him evil. Hatred of the neighbor
1 933 is a grave sin when one deliberately desires him grave harm. "But I
say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven.'197

Respect for and development of human life require peace. 1909
Peace is not merely the absence of war, and it is not limited to
maintaining a balance of powers between adversaries . Peace cannot be attained on earth without safeguarding the goods of persons, free communication among men, respect for the dignity of
persons and peoples, and the assiduous practice of fraternity. Peace
is "the tranquillity of order."98 Peace is the work of justice and the 1 807
effect of charity. 99
2305
Earthly peace is the image and fruit of the peace of Christ,
the messianic "Prince of Peace." 100 By the blood of his Cross, "in
his own person he killed the hostility," 101 he reconciled men with 1 468
God and made his Church the sacrament of the unity of the human
race and of its union with God. "He is our peace. " 102 He has
declared: "Blessed are the peacemakers." 103
2306
Those who renounce violence and bloodshed and, in order
to safeguard human rights, make use of those means of defense
available to the weakest, bear witness to evangelical charity, pro- 2267
vided they do so without harming the rights and obligations of

of the physical and moral risks of recourse to violence, with all its

2243 2309

The strict conditions for legitimate defense by military force
require rigorous consideration. The gravity of such a decision
makes it subject to rigorous conditions of moral legitimacy. At one
and the same time:

- the damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community
of nations must be lasting, grave, and certain;
- all other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to
be impractical or ineffective;
- there must be serious prospects of success;
- the use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than
the evil to be eliminated. The power of modern means of destruc­
tion weighs very heavily in evaluating this condition.
These are the traditional elements enumerated in what is called
the "just war" doctrine.

The evaluation of these conditions for moral legitimacy

1897 belongs to the prudential judgment of those who have responsibil­
ity for the common good.
2310
Public authorities, in this case, have the right and duty to
impose on citizens the obligations necessary for national defense.
Those who are sworn to serve their country in the armed
2239
1 909 forces are servants of the security and freedom of nations. If they
carry out their duty honorably, they truly contribute to the com­
mon good of the nation and the maintenance of peace. 107
2311
Public authorities should make equitable provision for
those who for reasons of conscience refuse to bear arms; these are
1 782, 1 790 nonetheless obliged to serve the human community in some other
way . 108
2312
The Church and human reason both assert the permanent
validity of the moral law during armed conflict. "The mere fact that
war has regrettably broken out does not mean that everything
becomes licit between the warring parties." 109

Non-combatants, wounded soldiers, and prisoners must
be respected and treated humanely.
Actions deliberately contrary to the law of nations and to
its universal principles are crimes, as are the orders that command
such actions. Blind obedience does not suffice to excuse those who
carry them out. Thus the extermination of a people, nation, or
ethnic minority must be condemned as a mortal sin. One is morally
bound to resist orders that command genocide.

"Every act of war directed to the indiscriminate destruc­

nation ."llO A danger of modern warfare is that it provides the
opportunity to those who possess modern scientific weapons especially atomic, biological, or chemical weapons - to commit
such crimes.
2315
The accumulation of arms strikes many as a paradoxically
suitable way of deterring potential adversaries from war. They see
it as the most effective means of ensuring peace among nations.
This method of deterrence gives rise to strong moral reservations.
The arms race does not ensure peace. Far from eliminating the
causes of war, it risks aggravating them. Spending enormous sums
to produce ever new types of weapons impedes efforts to aid needy
populations; l 1 1 it thwarts the development of peoples. Over-arma­
men t multiplies reasons for conflict and increases the danger of
escalation.
2316
The production and the sale of arms affect the common good
of nations and of the international community. Hence public
authorities have the right and duty to regulate them. The shortterm pursuit of private or collective interests cannot legitimate
undertakings that promote violence and conflict among na tions
and compromise the international juridical order.

Injustice, excessive economic or social inequalities, envy,
distrust, and pride raging among men and nations constantly
threaten peace and cause wars. Everything done to overcome these
disorders contributes to building up peace and avoiding war:

Every human life, from the moment of conception
until death, is sacred because the human person has
been willed for its own sake in the image and likeness
of the living and holy God.

The murder of a human being is gravely contrary to
the dignity of the person and the holiness of the Crea­

The prohibition of murder does not abrogate the right

Legitimate defense is a grave duty for whoever is

From its conception, the child has the right to life.
Direct abortion, that is, abortion willed as an end or as

against human life.

Because it should be treated as a person from concep­

God inscribed in the humanity of man and woman the vocation, and
thus the capacity and responsibility, of love and communion." 115

1 604
"God created man in his own image . . . male and female
he created them"; 1 16 He blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and
multiply" ; 117 "When God created man, he made him in the likeness
of G od. Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and
named them Man when they were created. " 1 18
2332
Sexuality affects all aspects of the human person in the
unity of his body and soul. It especially concerns affectivity, the
362 capacity to love and to procreate, and in a more general way the
aptitude for forming bonds of communion with others.
2333
Everyone, man and woman, should acknowledge and ac­
cept his sexual identity. Physical, moral, and spiritual difference and
complementarity are oriented toward the goods of marriage and the
flourishing of family life. The harmony of the couple and of society
1 603 depends in part on the way in which the complementarity, needs,
and mutual support between the sexes are lived out.

"In creating men 'male and female,' God gives man and
woman an equal personal dignity." 119 "Man is a person, man and 357
woman equally so, since both were created in the image and
likeness of the personal God." 120
2335
Each of the two sexes is an image of the power and tenderness of God, with equal dignity though in a different way. The
union of man and woman in marriage is a way of imitating in the flesh
the Creator's generosity and fecundity: "Therefore a man leaves his
father and his mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one 2205
flesh." 121 All human generations proceed from this union. l22

say to you that every one who looks at a woman lustfully has
already committed adultery with her in his heart." 123 What God
has joined together, let not man put asunder. l24
The tradition of the Church has understood the sixth com­
mandment as encompassing the whole of human sexuality.

THE VOCATI ON TO CHASTITY

2337
Chastity means the successful integration of sexuality 2349,
within the person and thus the inner unity of man in his bodily and 2520
spiritual being. Sexuality, in which man's belonging to the bodily
and biological world is expressed, becomes personal and truly
human when it is integrated into the relationship of one person to
another, in the complete and lifelong mutual gift of a man and a
woman.
The virtue of chastity therefore involves the integrity of the
person and the integrality of the gift.

The integrity of the person

2338
The chaste person maintains the integrity of the powers of
life and love placed in him. This integrity ensures the unity of the
person; it is opposed to any behavior that would impair it. It
tolerates neither a double life nor duplicity in speech. l 25
Chastity includes an apprenticeship in self-mastery which is
2339
a training in human freedom. The alternative is clear: either man
governs his passions and finds peace, or he lets himself be domi­
nated by them and becomes unhappy. l 26 "Man's dignity therefore
requires him to act out of conscious and free choice, as moved and
drawn in a personal way from within, and not by blind impulses
in himself or by mere external constraint. Man gains such dignity
when, ridding himself of all slavery to the passions, he presses
1 767 forward to his goal by freely choosing what is good and, by his
diligence and skill, effectively secures for himself the means suited
to this end." 127
2340

Whoever wants to remain faithful to his baptismal prom-

2015 ises and resist temptations will want to adopt the means for doing
so: self-knowledge, practice of an ascesis adapted to the situations
that confront him, obedience to G od's commandments, exercise of
the moral virtues, and fidelity to prayer. "Indeed it is through
chastity that we are gathered together and led back to the unity
from which we were fragmented into multiplicity." 128

1 809 2341
The virtue of chastity comes under the cardinal virtue of
temperance, which seeks to permeate the passions and appetites of
the senses with reason.
2342
Self-mastery is a long and exacting work. One can never
consider it acquired once and for all. It presupposes renewed effort
409 at all stages of life. l29 The effort required can be more intense in
certain periods, such as when the personality is being formed
during childhood and adolescence.

Chastity has laws ofgrowth which progress through stages
2343
marked by imperfection and too often by sin. "Man . . . day by day
builds himself up through his many free decisions; and so he 2223
knows, loves, and accomp lishes moral good by s tages o f
growth." 13°
2344
Chastity represents an eminently personal task; it also 2525
involves a cultural effort, for there is "an interdependence between
personal betterment and the improvement of society." 131 Chastity
presupposes respect for the rights of the person, in particular the
right to receive information and an education that respect the moral
and spiritual dimensions of human life.
2345
Chastity is a moral virtue. It is also a gift from God, a grace, 1810
a fruit o f spiritual effort. l 32 The Holy Spirit enables one whom the
water of Baptism has regenerated to imitate the purity of Christ. 133
The integrality of the gift of self
2346
Charity is the form of all the virtues. Under its influence, 1 827
chastity appears as a school of the gift of the person. Self-mastery
is ordered to the gift of self. Chastity leads him who practices it to
become a witness to his neighbor of God's fidelity and loving 210
kindness.
2347
The virtue of chastity blossoms in friendship. It shows the 374
disciple how to follow and imitate him who has chosen us as his
friends, l 34 who has given himself totally to us and allows us to
participate in his divine estate. Chastity is a promise of immortality.
Chastity is expressed notably in friendship with one's neigh­
bor. Whether it develops between persons of the same or opposite
sex, friendship represents a great good for all. It leads to spiritual
communion.

The various forms of chastity
2348
All the baptized are called to chastity. The Christian has
"put on Christ," 135 the model for all chastity. All Christ's faithful
are called to lead a chaste life in keeping with their particular states
of life. At the moment of his Baptism, the Christian is pledged to
lead his affective life in chastity.

1 620 2349

"People should cultivate [chastity] in the way that is suited
to their state of life. Some profess virginity or consecrated celibacy
which enables them to give themselves to God alone with an
undivided heart in a remarkable manner. Others live in the way
prescribed for all by the moral law, whether they are married or
single." 136 Married people are called to live conjugal chastity;
others practice chastity in continence:
There are three forms of the virtue of chastity: the first is that
of spouses, the second that of widows, and the third that of
virgins. We do not praise any one of them to the exclusion
of the others . . . . This is what makes for the richness of the
discipline of the Church. 137

Those who are engaged to marry are called to live chastity
in continence . They should see in this time of testing a discovery of
mutual respect, an apprenticeship in fidelity, and the hope of
receiving one another from God. They should reserve for marriage
the expressions of affection that belong to married love. They will
help each other grow in chastity.

Offenses against chastity

2528 2351

Lust is disordered desire for or inordinate enjoyment of
sexual pleasure . Sexual pleasure is morally disordered when
sought for itself, isolated from its procreative and unitive purposes.

2352
By mastu rba tio n is to be understood the deliberate stimu­
lation of the genital organs in order to derive sexual pleasure. "Both
the Magisterium of the Church, in the course of a constant tradition,
and the moral sense of the faithful have been in no doubt and have
firmly maintained that masturbation is an intrinsically and gravely
disordered action." 138 "The deliberate use of the sexual faculty, for

whatever reason, outside of marriage is essentially contrary to its
purpose." For here sexual pleasure is sought outside of "the sexual
relationship which is demanded by the moral order and in which
the total meaning of mutual self-giving and human procreation in
the context of true love is achieved." 139
To form an equitable judgment ab out the subjects' moral
responsibility and to guide pastoral action, one must take into
account the affective immaturity, force of acquired habit, condi­
tions of anxiety, or other psychological or social factors that can
lessen, if not even reduce to a minimum, moral culpability.
1 735

Fornication is carnal union between an unmarried man and
an unmarried woman. It is gravely contrary to the dignity of
persons and of human sexuality which is naturally ordered to the
good of spouses and the generation and education of children.
Moreover, it is a grave scandal when there is corruption of the
young.
2353

2354
Pornography consists in removing real or simulated sexual 2523
acts from the intimacy of the partners, in order to display them
deliberately to third parties. It offends against chastity because it
perverts the conjugal act, the intimate giving of spouses to each
other. It does grave injury to the dignity of its participants (actors,
vendors, the public), since each one becomes an object of base
pleasure and illicit profit for others. It immerses all who are in­
volved in the illusion of a fantasy world. It is a grave offense. Civil
authorities should prevent the production and distribution of por­
nographic materials .
2355
Prostitution does injury to the dignity of the person who
engages in it, reducing the person to an instrument of sexual
pleasure. The one who pays sins gravely against himself: he vio­
lates the chastity to which his Baptism pledged him and defiles his
body, the temple of the Holy Spirit. 140 Prostitution is a social
scourge. It usually involves women, but also men, children, and
adolescents (The latter two cases involve the added sin of scandal.).
While it is always gravely sinful to engage in prostitution, the
imputability of the offense can be attenuated by destitution, black1 735
mail, or social pressure.

Rape is the forcible viola tion of the sexual intimacy of
another person. It does injury to justice and charity. Rape deeply
wounds the respect, freedom, and physical and moral integrity to
which every person has a right. It causes grave damage that can
2297 mark the victim for life. It is always an intrinsically evil act. Graver
1 756 still is the rape of children committed by parents (incest) or those
2388 responsible for the education of the children entrusted to them.

Chastity and homosexuality
2357

Homosexuality refers to relations between men or be­
tween women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual
attraction toward persons of the same sex. It has taken a great
variety of forms through the centuries and in different cultures. Its
psychological genesis remains largely unexplained. Basing itself on
Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave
depravity, 141 tradition has always declared that "homosexual acts
are intrinsically disordered." 142 They are contrary to the natural
law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed
2333 from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no
circumstances can they be approved.
2358

The number of men and women who have deep-seated
homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is
objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. They
must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every
sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided.
These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if
they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the
difficulties they may encounter from their condition.

2347

2359

Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues
of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the
support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental
grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach
Christian perfection.

THE LOVE OF HUSBAND AND WIFE

2360
Sexuality is ordered to the conjugal love of man and
woman. In marriage the physical intimacy of the spouses becomes
a sign and pledge of spiritual communion. Marriage bonds be- 1601
tween baptized persons are sanctified by the sacrament.
"Sexuality, by means of which man and woman give them­
2361
selves to one another through the acts which are proper and
exclusive to spouses, is not something simply biological, but con- 1 643
cerns the innermost being of the human person as such. It is 2332
realized in a truly human way only if it is an integral part of the
love by which a man and woman commit themselves totally to one
another until death." 143
Tobias got out of bed and said to Sarah, "Sister, get up, and
let us pray and implore our Lord that he grant us mercy and
safety." So she got up, and they began to pray and implore
that they might be kept safe. Tobias began by saying,
"Blessed are you, 0 God of our fathers . . . . You made Adam,
and for him you made his wife Eve as a helper and support.
From the two of them the race of mankind has sprung. You
said, 'It is not good that the man should be alone; let us make
a helper for him like himself.' I now am taking this kinswoman of mine, not because of lust, but with sincerity. Grant
that she and I may find mercy and that we may grow old
together." And they both said, "Amen, Amen." Then they
went to sleep for the night. 144

2362
"The acts in marriage by which the intimate and chaste
union of the spouses takes place are noble and honorable; the truly
human performance of these acts fosters the self-giving they signify
and enriches the spouses in joy and gratitude." 145 Sexuality is a
source of joy and pleasure:
The Creator himself . . . established that in the [generative]
function, spouses should experience pleasure and enjoy­
ment of body and spirit. Therefore, the spouses do nothing
evil in seeking this pleasure and enjoyment. They accept
what the Creator has intended for them. At the same time,
spouses should know how to keep themselves within the
limits of just moderation. l 46

Conj ugal fidelity

2364
The married couple forms "the intimate partnership of life
and love established by the Creator and governed by his laws; it is
rooted in the conjugal covenant, that is, in their irrevocable per­
sonal consent." 147 Both give themselves definitively and totally to
one another. They are no longer two; from now on they form one
flesh. The covenant they freely contracted imposes on the spouses
the obligation to preserve it as unique and indissoluble. 148 "What
therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder." 149
2365
Fidelity expresses constancy in keeping one's given word.
God is faithful. The Sacrament of Matrimony enab les man and
woman to enter into Christ's fidelity for his Church. Through
conjugal chastity, they b ear witness to this mystery b efore the
world .
St. John Chrysostom suggests that young husbands should
say to their wives: I have taken you in my arms, and I love
you, and I prefer you to my life itself. For the present life is
nothing, and my most ardent dream is to spend it with you
in such a way that we may be assured of not being separated
in the life reserved for us . .
I place your love above all
things, and nothing would be more bittE�_r or painful to me
than to be of a different mind than you. bO

The fe cundity of marriage

1652-1 653

2366

Fecundity is a gift, an end of marriage, for conjugal love
naturally tends to be fruitful. A child does not come from outside
as something added on to the mutual love of the spouses, but
springs from the very heart of that mutual giving, as its fruit and
fulfillment. So the Church, which is "on the side of life," 151 teaches
that "it is necessary that each and every marriage act remain
ordered per se to the procreation of human life." 152 "This particular
doctrine, expounded on numerous occasions by the Magisterium,
is based on the inseparable connection, established by God, which
man on his own initiative may not break, between the unitive
significance and the procreative significance which are both inher­
ent to the marriage act." 153

2367

Called to give life, spouses share in the creative power and 2205
fatherhood of God. 154 "Married couples should regard it as their
proper mission to transmit human life and to educate their children; they should realize that they are thereby cooperating with the
love of God the Creator and are, in a certain sense, its interpreters.
They will fulfill this duty with a sense of human and Christian
responsibility." 155

2368
A particular aspect of this responsibility concerns the regu­
lation ofprocreation. For just reasons, spouses may wish to space the
births of their children. It is their duty to make certain that their
desire is not motivated by selfishness but is in conformity with the
generosity appropriate to responsible parenthood. Moreover, they
should conform their behavior to the objective criteria of morality:
When it is a question of harmonizing married love with the
responsible transmission of life, the morality of the behavior
does not depend on sincere intention and evaluation of
motives alone; but it must be determined by objective crite­
ria, criteria drawn from the nature of the person and his acts,
criteria that respect the total meaning of mutual self-giving
and human procreation in the context of true love; this is
possible only if the virtue of married chastity is practiced
with sincerity of heart. 156

"By sa feguarding both these essential aspects, the unitive
and the procreative, the conjugal act preserves in its fullness the
sense of true mutual love and its orientation toward man's exalted
vocation to parenthood." 157

2370
Periodic continence, that is, the methods of birth regula­
tion based on self-observation and the use of infertile periods, is in
conformity with the objective criteria of morality. 158 These meth­
ods respect the bodies of the spouses, encourage tenderness be­
tween them, and favor the education of an authentic freedom. In
contrast, "every action which, whether in anticipation of the con­
jugal act, or in its accomplishment, or in the development of its
natural consequences, proposes, whether as an end or as a means,
to render procreation impossible" is intrinsically evil: 159
Thus the innate language that expresses the total reciprocal
self-giving of husband and wife is overlaid, through contra­
ception, by an objectively contradictory language, namely,
that of not giving oneself totally to the other. This leads not
only to a positive refusal to be open to life but also to a
falsification of the inner truth of conjugal love, which is
called upon to give itself in personal totality . . . . The differ­
ence, both anthropological and moral, between contracep­
tion and recourse to the rhythm of the cycle . . . involves in
the final analysis two irreconcilable concepts of the human
person and of human sexuality. 160

2371

"Let all be convinced that human life and the duty of
transmitting it are not limited by the horizons of this life only: their
true evaluation and full significance can be understood only in
reference to man 's eternal destiny. " 161

2372
The state has a responsibility for its citizens' well-being. In this
capacity it is legitimate for it to intervene to orient the demography of the
population. This can be done by means of objective and respectful infor­
mation, but certainly not by authoritarian, coercive measures. The state
may not legitimately usurp the initiative of spouses, who have the primary
l
2209 responsibility for the procreation and education of their children. 62 In
this area, it is not authorized to employ means contrary to the moral law.

Sacred Scripture and the Church's traditional practice see

Couples who discover that they are sterile suffer greatly.

couraged, on condition that it is placed " at the service of the human
person, of his inalienable rights, and his true and integral good
according to the design and will of God l 66
."

2376

Techniques that entail the dissociation of husband and wife, by
the intrusion of a person other than the couple (donation of sperm or
ovum, surrogate uterus), are gravely immoral. These techniques (heterolo­
gous artificial insemination and fertilization) infringe the child's right to
be born of a father and mother known to him and bound to each other by
marriage. They betray the spouses' "right to become a father and a mother
only through each other." l67

2377
Techniques involving only the married couple (homologous ar­
tificial insemination and fertilization) are perhaps less reprehensible, yet
remain morally unacceptable. They dissociate the sexual act from the
procreative act. The act which brings the child into existence is no longer
an act by which two persons give themselves to one another, but one that
"entrusts the life and identity of the embryo into the power of doctors and
biologists and establishes the domination of technology over the origin
and destiny of the human person. Such a relationship of domination is in
itself contrary to the dignity and equality that must be common to parents
and children. " 168 "Under the moral aspect procreation is deprived of its
proper perfection when it is not willed as the fruit of the conjugal act, that
is to say, of the specific act of the spouses' union . . . . Only respect for the
link between the meanings of the conjugal act and respect for the unity of
the human being make possible procreation in conformity with the dignity
of the person." f69

OFFENSES AGAINST THE DIGNITY OF MARRIAGE

Adultery
2380

Adultery refers to marital infidelity. When two partners, of

whom at least one is married to another party, have sexual relations

- even transient ones - they commit adultery. Christ condemns
even adultery of mere desire . 171 The sixth commandment and the
New Testament forbid adultery absolutely. 172 The prophets de­

1611

nounce the gravity of adultery; they see it as an image of the sin of
idolatry. 173

2381

Adultery is an injustice. He who commits adultery fails in

his commitment. He does inj ury to the sign of the covenant which

1 640 the marriage bond is, transgresses the rights of the other spouse,
and undermines the institution of marriage by breaking the con­
tract on which it is based. He compromises the good of human

generation and the welfare of children who need their parents'
stable union.

Divorce

2382
The Lord Jesus insisted on the original intention of the
Creator who willed that marriage be indissoluble. 1 74 He abrogates 1614
the accommodations that had slipped into the old Law PS
Between the baptized, "a ratified and consummated mar­
riage cannot be dissolved by any human power or for any reason
other than death." 1 76
2383
The separation of spouses while maintaining the marriage 1 649
bond can be legitimate in certain cases provided for by canon
law. 177
If civil divorce remains the only possible way of ensuring certain
legal rights, the care of the children, or the protection of inheritance, it can
be tolerated and does not constitute a moral offense.

2384

Divorce is a grave offense against the natural law. It claims

to break the contract_ to which the spouses freely consented, to live
with each other till death. Divorce does injury to the covenant of
salvation, of which sacramental marriage is the sign. Contracting
a new union, even if it is recognized by civil law, adds to the gravity
of the rupture: the remarried spouse is then in a situation of public
and permanent adultery:
If a husband, separated from his wife, approaches another

commit adultery; and the woman who lives with him is an

Divorce is immoral also because it introduces disorder into
the family and into society. This disorder brings grave harm to the
deserted spouse, to children traumatized by the separation of their
parents and often tom between them, and because of its contagious
effect which makes it truly a plague on society.

It can happen that one of the spouses is the innocent victim
of a divorce decreed by civil law; this spouse therefore has not
contravened the moral law. There is a considerable difference
between a spouse who has sincerely tried to be faithful to the
sacrament of marriage and is unjustly abandoned, and one who
1 640 through his own grave fault destroys a canonically valid mar­
riage. l 79

Other offenses against the dignity of marriage

2387
The predicament of a man who, desiring to convert to the
Gospel, is obliged to repudiate one or more wives with whom he
has shared years of conjugal life, is understandable. However
1610 polygamy is not in accord with the moral law. " [Conjugal] commun­
ion is radically contradicted by polygamy; this, in fact, directly
negates the plan of God which was revealed from the beginning,
because it is contrary to the equal personal dignity of men and
women who in matrimony give themselves with a love that is total
and therefore unique and exclusive." 180 The Christian who has
previously lived in polygamy has a grave duty in justice to honor
the obligations contracted in regard to his former wives and his
children.
2356 2388

Incest designates intimate relations between relatives or
in-laws within a degree that prohibits marriage between them . l81
St. Paul stigmatizes this especially grave offense: "It is actually
reported that there is immorality among you . . . for a man is living
with his father's wife . . . . In the name of the Lord Jesus . . . you are
to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh . . . . " 182
2207 Incest corrupts family relationships and marks a regression toward
animality.

2389
Connected to incest is any sexual abuse perpetrated by
adults on children or adolescents entrusted to their care. The of­
fense is compounded by the scandalous harm done to the physical
2285 and moral integrity of the young, who will remain scarred by it all
their lives; and the violation of responsibility for their upbringing.

In a so-calledfree union, a man and a woman refuse to give
juridical and public form to a liaison involving sexual intimacy.
1 63 1
The expression " free union" i s fallacious: what can "union" mean
when the partners make no commitment to one another, each exhibiting
a lack of trust in the other, in himself, or in the future?

The expression covers a number of different situations:
concubinage, rejection of marriage as such, or inability to make
long-term commitments. J 83 All these situations offend against the
dignity of marriage; they destroy the very idea of the family; they
weaken the sense of fidelity. They are contrary to the moral law. 2353
The sexual act must take place exclusively within marriage. Outside of marriage it always constitutes a grave sin and excludes one
1385
from sacramental communion.
Some today claim a "right to a trial marriage" where there
is an intention of getting married later. However firm the purpose
of those who engage in premature sexual relations may be, "the
fact is that such liaisons can scarcely ensure mutual sincerity and
fidelity in a relationship between a man and a woman, nor, espe­
cially, can they protect it from inconstancy of desires or whim. " 184

2391

Carnal union is morally legitimate only when c definitive community of life between a man and woman has been established.
Human love does not tolerate " trial marriages. " It demands a total 2364
and definitive gift of persons to one another . ISS

"Love is the fundamental and inn a te vocation of every

and accept his sexual identity.

Chastity means the integration of sexuality within the

Among the sins gravely contrary to chastity are mas­
turbation, fornication, pornography, and homosexual
practices.

2397

The covenant which spouses have freely entered into
entails faithful love. It imposes on them the obligation
to keep their marriage indissoluble.

2398

Fecundity is a good, a gift and an end of marriage. By
giving life, spouses participate in God's fatherhood.

2399

The regulation of births represents one of the aspects
of responsible fatherhood and motherhood. Legiti­
mate intentions on the part of the spouses do not
justify recourse to morally unacceptable means (for
example, direct sterilization or contraception) .

Adultery, divorce, polygamy, and free union are grave
offenses against the dignity of marriage.

ARTICLE 7
THE SEVENTH COMMANDMENT

You shall not steai. 1 86
The seventh commandment forbids unjustly taking or
keeping the goods of one's neighbor and wronging him in any way
with respect to his goods. It commands justice and charity in the 1 807
care of earthly goods and the fruits of men's labor. For the sake of
the common good, it requires respect for the universal destination
of goods and respect for the right to private property. Christian life
strives to order this world's goods to God and to fraternal charity. 952

2401

I.

THE UNIVERSAL DESTINATION AND THE PRIVATE
OWNERSHIP OF GOODS

In the beginning God entrusted the earth and its resources
to the common stewardship of mankind to take care of them,
master them by labor, and enjoy their fruits. 187 The goods of 226
creation are destined for the whole human race. However, the earth
is divided up among men to assure the security of their lives,
endangered by poverty and threatened by violence. The appropriation of property is legitimate for guaranteeing the freedom and
dignity of persons and for helping each of them to meet his basic
needs and the needs of those in his charge. It should allow for a
1939
natural solidarity to develop between men.

2402

2403 The right to private property, acquired or received in a just
way, does not do away with the original gift of the earth to the
whole of mankind. The universal destination of goods remains pri­
mordial, even if the promotion of the common good requires
respect for the right to private property and its exercise.

186 Ex 20:15; Deut 5:19; Mt 19:18.
187 Cf. Gen 1 :26-29.

Part Three

578

2404
"In his use of things man should regard the external goods
he legitimately owns not merely as exclusive to himself but com­
mon to others also, in the sense that they can benefit others as well
as himself." 188 The ownership of any property makes its holder a
307 steward of Providence, with the task of making it fruitful and
communicating its benefits to others, first of all his family.
2405
Goods of production - material or immaterial - such as land,
factories, practical or artistic skills, oblige their possessors to employ them
in ways that will benefit the greatest number. Those who hold goods for
use and consumption should use them with moderation, reserving the
better part for guests, for the sick and the poor.
1 903 2406

Political authority has the right and duty to regulate the
legitimate exercise of the right to ownership for the sake of the
common good. l 89

II.

RESPECT FOR PERSONS AND THEIR GOODS

2407

In economic matters, respect for human dignity requires
the practice of the virtue of temperance, so as to moderate attach1 809 ment to this world's goods; the practice of the virtue of justice, to
1 807 preserve our neighbor's rights and render him what is his due; and
1 939 the practice of solidarity, in accordance with the golden rule and in
keeping with the generosity of the Lord, who "though he was rich,
yet for your sake . . . became poor so that by his poverty, you might
become rich." 190

Respect for the goods of others

2408

The seventh commandment forbids theft, that is, usurping
another's property against the reasonable will of the owner. There
is no theft if consent can be presumed or if refusal is contrary to
reason and the universal destination of goods. This is the case in
obvious and urgent necessity when the only way to provide for
immediate, essential needs (food, shelter, clothing . . .) is to put at
one's disposal and use the property of others. 191

579

2409
Even if it does not contradict the provisions of civil law,
any form of unjustly taking and keeping the property of others is
against the seventh commandment: thus, deliberate retention of
goods lent or of objects lost; business fraud; paying unjust wages; 1 867
forcing up prices by taking advantage of the ignorance or hardship
of another .192
The following are also morally illicit: speculation in which one
contrives to manipulate the price of goods artificially in order to gain an
advantage to the detriment of others; corruption in which one influences
the judgment of those who must make decisions according to law; appro­
priation and use for private purposes of the common goods of an enter­
prise; work poorly done; tax evasion; forgery of checks and invoices;
excessive expenses and waste. Willfully damaging private or public prop­
erty is contrary to the moral law and requires reparation.

2410
Promises must be kept and contracts strictly observed to the 2 1 01
extent that the commitments made in them are morally just. A
significant part of economic and social life depends on the honoring
of contracts between physical or moral persons - commercial contracts of purchase or sale, rental or labor contracts. All contracts
must be agreed to and executed in good faith.
2411
Contracts are subject to commu tative justice which regulates 1 807
exchanges between persons and between institutions in accordance with a strict respect for their rights. Commutative justice
obliges strictly; it requires safeguarding property rights, paying
debts, and fulfilling obligations freely contracted. Without commutative justice, no other form of justice is possible.
One distinguishes commutative justice from legal justice which
concerns what the citizen owes in fairness to the community, and from
distributive justice which regulates what the community owes its citizens
in proportion to their contributions and needs.

2412

In virtue of commutative j ustice, rep a ra tio n fo r injustice 1 459
committed requires the restitution of stolen goods to their owner:
Jesus blesses Zacchaeus for his pledge: "If I have defrauded
anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold." 19 3' Those who, directly or
indirectly, have taken possession of the goods of another, are obliged to
make restitution of them, or to return the equivalent in kind or in money,
if the goods have disappeared, as well as the profit or advantages their
owner would have legitimately obtained from them. Likewise, all who in
some manner have taken part in a theft or who have knowingly benefited
from it - for example, those who ordered it, assisted in it, or received the
stolen goods - are obliged to make restitution in proportion to their
responsibility and to their share of what was stolen.

193 Lk 19:8.

2413

Games of chance (card games, etc.) or wagers are not in themselves
contrary to justice. They become morally unacceptable when they deprive
someone of what is necessary to provide for his needs and those of others.
The passion for gambling risks becoming an enslavement. Unfair wagers
and cheating at games constitute grave matter, unless the damage inflicted
is so slight that the one who suffers it cannot reasonably consider it
significant.

2297 2414
The seventh commandment forbids acts or enterprises that
for any reason - selfish or ideological, commerciat or totalitarian
- lead to the enslavement ofhuman beings, to their being bought, sold
and exchanged like merchandise, in disregard for their personal
dignity. It is a sin against the dignity of persons and their funda­
mental rights to reduce them by violence to their productive value
or to a source of profit. St. Paul directed a Christian master to treat
his Christian slave "no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as
a beloved brother, . . . both in the flesh and in the Lord . "194

Respect for the integrity of creation

226, 358 2415
The seventh commandment enjoins respect for the integrity of creation. Animals, like plants and inanimate beings, are by
nature destined for the common good of past, present, and future
humanity. 195 Use of the mineral, vegetable, and animal resources
of the universe cannot be divorced from respect for moral impera373 tives. Man's dominion over inanimate and other living beings
granted by the Creator is not absolute; it is limited by concern for
the quality of life of his neighbor, including generations to come; it
378 requires a religious respect for the integrity of creation. l 96
2416
Animals are God's creatures . He surrounds them with his
providential care. By their mere existence they bless him and give
him glory. 197 Thus men owe them kindness. We should recall the
344 gentleness with which saints like St. Francis of Assisi or St. Philip
Neri treated animals.

God entrusted animals to the stewardship of those whom
he created in his own image . 198 Hence it is legitimate to use animals
for food and clothing. They may be domesticated to help man in
his work and leisure. Medical and scientific experimentation on
animals is a morally acceptable practice if it remains within reasonable
limits and contributes to caring for or saving human lives.
2234
2418
It is contrary to human dignity to cause animals to suffer
or die needlessly. It is likewise tmworthy to spend money on them
that should as a priority go to the relief of human misery. One can 2446
love animals; one should not direct to them the affection due only
to persons.

III.

THE SOCIAL DOCTRINE OF THE CHURCH

2419
"Christian revelation . . . promotes deeper understanding 1960
of the laws of social living." 1 99 The Church receives from the 359
Gospel the full revelation of the truth about man. When she fulfills
her mission of proclaiming the Gospel, she bears witness to man,
in the name of Christ, to his dignity and his vocation to the com­
munion of persons. She teaches him the demands of justice and
peace in conformity with divine wisdom.
2420

The Church makes a moral judgment about economic and 2032
social matters, "when the fundamental rights of the person or the
salvation of souls requires it."200 In the moral order she bears a
mission distinct from that of political authorities: the Church is
concerned with the temporal aspects of the common good because
they are ordered to the sovereign Good, our ultimate end . She 2246
strives to inspire right attitudes with respect to earthly goods and
in socio-economic relationships.

2421
The social doctrine o f the Church developed i n the nineteenth
century when the Gospel encountered modern industrial society with its
new structures for the production of consumer goods, its new concept of
society, the state and authority, and its new forms of labor and ownership.
The development of the doctrine of the Church on economic and social matters
attests the permanent value of the Church's teaching at the same time as it
l
attests the true meaning of her Tradition, always living and active.20

Part Three

2422
The Church's social teaching comprises a body of doctrine,
which is articulated as the Church interprets events in the course
of history, with the assistance of the Holy Spirit, in the light of the
whole of what has been revealed by Jesus Christ. 202 This teaching
can be more easily accepted by men of good will, the more the
faithful let themselves be guided by it.
2423

The Church's social teaching proposes principles for re­
flection; it provides criteria for judgment; it gives guidelines for
action:

Any system in which social relationships are determined entirely
by economic factors is contrary to the nature of the human person and his
acts. 203

2424
A theory that makes profit the exclusive norm and ultimate end
of economic activity is morally unacceptable. The disordered desire for
2 3 1 7 money cannot but produce perverse effects. It is one of the causes of the
many conflicts which disturb the social order.204
A system that "subordinates the basic rights of individuals and
of groups to the collective organization of production" is contrary to
human dignity.205 Every practice that reduces persons to nothing more
than a means of profit enslaves man, leads to idolizing money, and
contributes to the spread of atheism. "You cannot serve God and mam­
mon.''206

2425

The Church has rejected the totalitarian and atheistic ideologies
associated in modern times with "communism" or "socialism." She has
676 likewise refused to accept, in the practice of "capitalism," individualism
and the absolute primacy of the law of the marketplace over human
labor. 207 Regulating the economy solely by centralized planning perverts
the basis of social bonds; regulating it solely by the law of the marketplace
fails social justice, for "there are many human needs which cannot be
satisfied by the market.'' 208 Reasonable regulation of the marketplace and
economic initiatives, in keeping with a just hierarchy of values and a view
1 886 to the common good, is to be commended.

EcoNOMIC AcnviTY AND S ociAL JusncE

2426
The development of economic activity and growth in pro­
duction are meant to provide for the needs of human beings.
Economic life is not meant solely to multiply goods produced and
increase profit or power; it is ordered first of all to the service of
persons, of the whole man, and of the entire human community.
Economic activity, conducted according to its own proper methods,
is to be exercised within the limits of the moral order, in keeping with
social justice so as to correspond to God's plan for man.209
1 928
2427
Human work proceeds directly from persons created in the 307
image of God and called to prolong the work of creation by
subduing the earth, both with and for one another. 2 10 Hence work 378
is a duty: "If any one will not work, let him not eat."2 11 Work honors
the Creator's gifts and the talents received from him. It can also be
redemptive. By enduring the hardship of work2 12 in union with 53 1
Jesus, the carpenter of Nazareth and the one crucified on Calvary,
man collaborates in a certain fashion with the Son of God in his
redemptive work. He shows himself to be a disciple of Christ by
carrying the cross, daily, in the work he is called to accomplish.213
Work can be a means of sanctification and a way of animating
earthly realities with the Spirit of Christ.
2428
In work, the person exercises and fulfills in p art the paten- 2834
tial inscribed in his nature. The primordial value of labor stems
from man himself, its author and its beneficiary. Work is for man, 2 1 85
not man for work.2 1 4
Everyone should be able to draw from work the means of
providing for his life and that of his family, and of serving the
human community.
2429
Everyone has the right of economic initiative; everyone
should make legitimate use of his talents to contribute to the
abundance that will benefit all and to harvest the just fruits of his
labor. He should seek to observe regulations issued by legitimate
authority for the sake of the common good.2 1 5

Economic life brings into play different interests, often op­
posed to one another. This explains why the conflicts that charac­
terize it arise. 216 Efforts should be made to reduce these conflicts
by negotiation that respects the rights and duties of each social
partner: those responsible for business enterprises, representatives
of wage-earners (for example, trade unions), and public authorities
when appropriate.
2431

The responsibility of the state. "Economic activity, especially
the activity of a market economy, cannot be conducted in an
institutional, juridical, or political vacuum. On the contrary, it
presupposes sure guarantees of individual freedom and private
property, as well as a stable currency and efficient public services.
1 908 Hence the principal task of the state is to guarantee this security, so
that those who work and produce can enjoy the fruits of their labors
and thus feel encouraged to work efficiently and honestly. . . . Another
task of the state is that of overseeing and directing the exercise of
human rights in the economic sector. However, primary responsi1 883 bility in this area belongs not to the state but to individuals and to
the various groups and associations which make up society. "217

2432

Those responsible for business enterprises are responsible to
society for the economic and ecological effects of their opera2415 tions. 218 They have an obligation to consider the good of persons
and not only the increase of profits. Profits are necessary, however.
They make possible the investments that ensure the future of a
business and they guarantee employment.

2433
Access to employment and to professions must be open to all
without unjust discrimination: men and women, healthy and dis­

A ju st wage is the legitimate fruit of work. To refuse or
withhold it can be a grave injustice. 221 In determining fair pay both
the needs and the contributions of each person must be taken into

On the international level, inequality of resources and

economic capability is such that it creates a real "gap" between
nations. 224 On the one side there are those nations possessing and
developing the means of growth and, on the other, those accumu­

lating debts.

2438

Various causes of a religious, political, economic, and fi­

nancial nature today give "the social question a worldwide dimen­
sion." 225 There must be solidarity among nations which are already
politically interdependent. It i s even more essential when i t is a

1911

question of dismantling the "perverse mechanisms" that impede
the development of the less advanced countries .226 In place of

abusive if not usurious financial systems, iniquitous commercial

relations among na tions, and the arms race, there must be substi-

tuted a common effort to mobilize resources toward objectives of

moral, cultural, and economic development, "redefining the priorities and hierarchies o f values . "227

Rich nations have a grave moral responsibility toward
those which are unable to ensure the means of their development
by themselves or have been prevented from doing so by tragic
historical events. It is a duty in solidarity and charity; it is also an
obligation in justice if the prosperity of the rich nations has come
from resources that have not been paid for fairly.
2440

Direct aid is an appropriate response to immediate, extraor­
dinary needs caused by natural catastrophes, epidemics, and the
like. But it does not suffice to repair the grave damage resulting
from destitution or to provide a lasting solution to a country's
needs. It is also necessary to reform international economic and
financial institutions so that they will better promote equitable
relationships with less advanced countries.228 The efforts of poor
countries working for growth and liberation must be supported.229
This doctrine must be applied especially in the area of agricultural
labor. Peasants, especially in the Third World, form the over­
whelming majority of the poor.
An increased sense of God and increased self-awareness
are fundamental to any full development of human society. This de­
velopment multiplies material goods and puts them at the service
of the person and his freedom. It reduces dire poverty and eco­
nomic exploitation. It makes for growth in respect for cultural
identities and openness to the transcendent. 230

tradition." This love is inspired by the Gospel of the Beatitudes, of
the poverty of Jesus, and of his concern for the poor. 235 Love for 1 71 6
the poor i s even one of the motives for the duty o f working s o as
to "be able to give to those in need." 236 It extends not only to
material poverty but also to the many forms of cultural and religious poverty. 237

2445

Love for the poor is incompatible with immoderate love of 2536
riches or their selfish use:
Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that
are coming upon you. Your riches have rotted and your
garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver have rusted,
and their rust will be evidence against you and will eat your
flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure for the last days.
Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields,
which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the
harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. You
have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure; you have
fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter. You have condemned, y:ou have killed the righteous man; he does not
resist you.238

2446
St. John Chrysostom vigorously recalls this: "Not to enable
the poor to share in our goods is to steal from them and deprive
them of life. The goods we possess are not ours, but theirs."239 "The
demands of justice must be satisfied first of all; that which is 2402
already due in justice is not to be offered as a gift of charity" : 240

The w o rks of m e rcy are charitable actions by which we
come to the aid of our neighb or in his spiritual and bodily necessi­
ties.242 Instructing, advising, consoling, comforting are spiritual
works of mercy, as are forgiving and bearing wrongs patiently. The
corporal works of mercy consist especially in feeding the hungry,
sheltering the homeless, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and
imprisoned, and burying the dead. 243 Among all these, giving alms
to the poor is one of the chief witnesses to fraternal charity: it is also
a work of justice pleasing to God:244
He who has two coats, let him share with him who has none;
and he who has food must do likewise. 245 But give for alms
those things which are within; and behold, everything is
clean for you. 246 If a brother or sister is ill-clad and in lack
of daily food, and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be
warmed and filled," without givin!;.them the things needed
for the body, what does it profit?2

2448
"In its various forms - material deprivation, unjust oppres­
sion, physical and psychological illness and death - human misery
is the obvious sign of the inherited condition of frailty and need for
salvation in which man finds himself as a consequence of original
sin. This misery elicited the compassion of Christ the Savior, who
willingly took it upon himself and identified himself with the least
of his brethren. Hence, those who are oppressed by poverty are the
object of a preferen tial love on the part of the Church which, since
her origin and in spite of the failings of many of her members, has
not ceased to work for their relief, defense, and liberation through
numerous works of charity which remain indispensable always
and everywhere. "248

Beginning with the Old Testament, all kinds of juridical
measures (the jubilee year of forgiveness of debts, prohibition of
loans at interest and the keeping of collateral, the obligation to tithe,
the daily payment of the day-laborer, the right to glean vines and
fields) answer the exhortation of De u te ro no m y : "For the poor will
never cease out of the land; therefore I command you, 'You shall
open wide your hand to your brother, to the needy and to the poor
in the land .' "249 Jesus makes these words his own: "The poor you
always have with you, but you do not always have me." 250 In so
doing he does not soften the vehemence of former oracles against
"buying the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals . . . ,"
but invites us to recognize his own presence in the poor who are 1397
his brethren: 251
When her mother reproached her for caring for the poor and
the sick at home, St. Rose of Lima said to her: "When we
serve the poor and the sick, we serve Jesus. We must not fail
to help our neighbors, because in them we serve Jesus. 252

"You shall not steal" (Ex 20: 15; De u t 5:19). "Neither

The seventh commandment enjoins the practice of
justice and charity in the administration of earthly
goods and the fruits of men's labor.

2452

The goods of creation are destined for the entire hu­
man race. The right to private property does not abol­
ish the universal destination of goods.

2453

The seventh commandment forbids theft. Theft is the
usurpation of another's goods against the reasonable
will of the owner.

2454

Every manner of taking and using another's property
unjustly is contrary to the seventh commandment. The
injustice committed requires reparation. Commuta­
tive justice requires the restitution of stolen goods.

The moral law forbids acts which, for commercial or
totali tarian purposes, lead to the enslavement of hu­
man beings, or to their being bought, sold or ex­
changed like merchandise.

2456

The dominion granted by the Creator over the mineral,
vege table, and animal resources of the universe cannot
be separated from respect for moral obligations, in­
cluding those toward generations to come.

2457

Animals are entrusted to man's stewardship; he must
show them kindness. They may be used to serve the
just satisfac tion of man's needs.

2458

The Church makes a judgment about economic and
social matters when the fundamental rights of the
person or the salvation of souls requires it. She is
concerned with the temporal common good of men
because they are ordered to the sovereign Good, their
ultima te end .

2459

Man is himself the author, center, and goal of all
economic and social life. The decisive point of the
social question is that goods created by God for every­
one should in fact reach everyone in accordance with
justice and with the help of charity.

2460

The primordial value of labor sterns from man himself,
its author and beneficiary. By means of his labor man
participates in the work of creation. Work united to
Christ can be redemptive.

2461

True development concerns the whole man. It is con­
cerned with increasing each person's ability to re­
spond to his vocation and hence to God's call (cf.

CA

2462

Giving alms to the poor is a witness to fraternal char­
ity: it is also a work of justice pleasing to God.

How can we not recognize Lazarus, the hungry beggar

THE EIGHTH COMMANDMENT
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. 253
It was said to the men of old, "You shall not swear falsely,
but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn."254

2464

The eighth commandment forbids misrepresenting the
truth in our relations with others. This moral prescription flows
from the vocation of the holy people to bear witness to their God
who is the truth and wills the truth. Offenses against the truth
express by word or deed a refusal to commit oneself to moral
uprightness: they are fundamental infidelities to God and, in this
sense, they undermine the foundations of the covenant.

I.

LIVING IN THE

TRUTH

The Old Testament attests that God is the source of all truth. 215
His Word is truth. His Law is truth. His "faithfulness endures to
all generations." 255 Since God is "true," the members of his people
are called to live in the truth 256

2465

.

2466
In Jesus Christ, the whole of God's truth has been made
manifest. "Full of grace and truth," he came as the "light of the
world," he is the Truth. 257 "Whoever believes in me may not remain
in darkness."258 The disciple of Jesus continues in his word so as
to know " the truth [that] will make you free" and that sanctifies.259
To follow Jesus is to live in "the Spirit of truth," whom the Father
sends in his name and who leads "into all the truth."26° To his 2153
disciples Jesus teaches the unconditional love of truth: "Let what
you say be simply 'Yes or No."'261

253 Ex 20: 16; cf. Deut 5:20.
254 Mt 5:33.
255 Ps 119:90; cf. Prov 8:7; 2 Sam 7:28; Ps 119:142; Lk 1:50.

592

Part Three

2467
Man tends by nature toward the truth. He is obliged to
honor and bear witness to it: "It is in accordance with their dignity
2104 that all men, because they are persons . . . are both impelled by their
nature and bound by a moral obligation to seek the truth, especially
religious truth. They are also bound to adhere to the truth once they
come to know it and direct their whole lives in accordance with the
demands of truth."262
2468
Truth as uprightness in human action and speech is called
truthfulness, sincerity, or candor. Truth or truthfulness is the virtue
1 458 which consists in showing oneself true in deeds and truthful in
words, and in guarding against duplicity, dissimulation, and hy­
pocrisy.

2469

"Men could not live with one another if there were not
mutual confidence that they were being truthful to one another."263
1 807 The virtue of truth gives another his just due. Truthfulness keeps
to the just mean between what ought to be expressed and what
ought to be kept secret: it entails honesty and discretion. In justice,
"as a matter of honor, one man owes it to another to manifest the
truth." 264
2470

The disciple of Christ consents to "live in the truth," that
is, in the simplicity of a life in conformity with the Lord's example,
abiding in his truth . "If we say we have fellowship with him while
we walk in darkness, we lie and do not live according to the
truth."265

II.

To BEAR WITNESS TO THE TRUTH

2471
Before Pilate, Christ proclaims that he "has come into the
world, to bear witness to the truth."266 The Christian is not to "be
1816 ashamed then of testifying to our Lord."267 In situations that re­
quire witness to the faith, the Christian must profess it without
equivocation, after the example of St. Paul before his judges. We
must keep "a clear conscience toward God and toward men."268

The duty of Christians to take part in the life of the Church
impels them to act as witnesses of the Gospel and of the obligations
that flow from it. This witness is a transmission of the faith in words 863, 905
and deeds. Witness is an act of justice that establishes the truth or
makes it known. 269
1807
All Christians by the example of their lives and the witness
of their word, wherever they live, have an obligation to
manifest the new man which they have put on in Baptism
and to reveal the power of the Holt Spirit by whom they
were strengthened at Confirmation. 70

2473

Martyrdom is the supreme witness given to the truth of the 852
faith: it means bearing witness even unto death. The martyr bears
witness to Christ who died and rose, to whom he is united by
charity. He bears witness to the truth of the faith and of Christian 1 808
doctrine. He endures death through an act of fortitude. "Let me
become the food of the beasts, through whom it will be given me
to reach God." 271
1 258
2474

The Church has painstakingly collected the records of
those who persevered to the end in witnessing to their faith. These
are the acts of the Martyrs. They form the archives of truth written
in letters of blood:
Neither the pleasures of the world nor the kingdoms of this
age will b e o f any use to me. I t i s better for m e to die [in order
to unite myself] to Christ Jesus than to reign over the ends
of the earth. I seek him who died for us; I desire him who
rose for us. My birth is approaching . . . .272
I bless you for having judged me worthy from this day and
this hour to be counted among your martyrs. . . . You have
kept your promise, God of faithfulness and truth. For this
reason and for everything, I praise you, I bless you, I glorify
you through the eternal and heavenly High Priest, Jesus
Christ, your beloved Son. Through him, who is with you and
the Holy Spirit, may Jdory be given to you, now and in the
ages to come. Amen. 273

OFFENSES AGAINST TRUTH

2475

Christ's disciples have "put on the new man, created after
the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness." 274 By
"putting away falsehood," they are to "put away all malice and all
guile and insincerity and envy and all slander." 275
2 1 52

2476

False witness and perjury. When it is made publicly, a statement contrary to the truth takes on a particular gravity. In court it
becomes false witness. 276 When it is under oath, it is perjury. Acts
such as these contribute to condemnation of the innocent, exonera­
tion of the guilty, or the increased punishment of the accused.277
They gravely compromise the exercise of justice and the fairness of
judicial decisions.
2477
Respect for the reputation of persons forbids every attitude
and word likely to cause them unjust injury.278 He becomes guilty:
- of rash judgment who, even tacitly, assumes as true, without
sufficient foundation, the moral fault of a neighbor;
- of detraction who, without objectively valid reason, discloses
another's faults and failings to persons who did not know them;279
- of calumny who, by remarks contrary to the truth, harms the
reputation of others and gives occasion for false judgments con­
cerning them.

2478

To avoid rash judgment, everyone should be careful to
interpret insofar as possible his neighbor's thoughts, words, and
deeds in a favorable way:
Every good Christian ought to be more ready to give a
favorable interpretation to another's statement than to con­
demn it. But if he cannot do so, let him ask how the other
understands it. And if the latter understands it badly, let the
former correct him with love. If that does not suffice, let the
Christian try all suitable ways to bring the other to a correct
interpretation so that he may be saved. 280

Life in Christ

595

2479
Detraction and calumny destroy the reputation and honor of
one's neighbor. Honor is the social witness given to human dignity,
and everyone enjoys a natural right to the honor of his name and
reputation and to respect. Thus, detraction and calumny offend 1 753
against the virtues of justice and charity.

2480
Every word or attitude is forbidden which by flattery,
adulation, or complaisance encourages and confirms another in ma­
licious acts and perverse conduct. Adulation is a grave fault if it
makes one an accomplice in another's vices or grave sins. Neither
the desire to be of service nor friendship justifies duplicitous
speech. Adulation is a venial sin when it only seeks to be agreeable,
to avoid evil, to meet a need, or to obtain legitimate advantages.

2481
Boasting or bragging is an offense against truth. So is irony
aimed at disparaging someone by maliciously caricaturing some
aspect of his behavior.
2482

"A lie consists in speaking a falsehood with the intention
of deceiving. "28I The Lord denounces lying as the work of the
devil: "You are of your father the devil, . . . there is no truth in him.
When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar
and the father of lies."282
392

2483

Lying is the most direct offense against the truth. To lie is
to speak or act against the truth in order to lead someone into error.
By injuring man's relation to truth and to his neighbor, a lie offends
against the fundamental relation of man and of his word to the
Lord.

2484

The gravity of a lie is measured against the nature of the
truth it deforms, the circumstances, the intentions of the one who
lies, and the harm suffered by its victims. To lie is to speak or act 1 750
against the truth in order to lead someone into error.

2485

By its very nature, lying is to be condemned. It is a profa- 1 756
nation of speech, whereas the purpose of speech is to communicate
known truth to others . The deliberate intention of leading a neighbor into error by saying things contrary to the truth constitutes a
failure in justice and charity. The culpability is greater when the
intention of deceiving entails the risk of deadly consequences for
those who are led astray.

281 St. Augustine, De m endacio 4, 5: PL 40, 491 .
282 Jn 8:44.

596

Part Three

2486
Since it violates the virtue of truthfulness, a lie does real
violence to another. It affects his ability to know, which is a condi­
tion of every judgment and decision. It contains the seed of discord
1 607 and all consequent evils. Lying is des tructive of society; it under­
mines trust among men and tears apart the fabric of social relation­
ships.
1 459 2487
Every offense committed against justice and truth entails
the duty of reparation, even if its author has been forgiven. When it
is impossible publicly to make reparation for a wrong, it must be
made secretly. If someone who has suffered harm cannot be di2412 rectly compensated, he must be given moral satisfaction in the
name of charity. This duty of reparation also concerns offenses
against another's reputation . This reparation, moral and some­
times material, must be evaluated in terms of the extent of the
damage inflicted. It obliges in conscience.

IV.

RESPECT FOR THE TRUTH

1 740 2488

The right to the communication of the truth is not unconditional. Everyone must conform his life to the Gospel precept of
fraternal love. This requires us in concrete situations to judge
whether or not it is appropriate to reveal the truth to someone who
asks for it.

2489
Charity and respect for the truth should dictate the re­
sponse to every request for information or communication. The good
and safety of others, respect for privacy, and the common good are
sufficient reasons for being silent about what ought not be known
or for making use of a discreet language. The duty to avoid scandal
2284 often commands strict discretion. No one is bound to reveal the
truth to someone who does not have the right to know it. 283
1 467 2490

The secret of the sacrament of reconciliation is sacred, and
cann ot be violated under any pretext. "The sacramental seal is
inviolable; therefore, it is a crime for a confessor in any way to
betray a penitent by word or in any other manner or for any
reason."284

2491

Professional secrets

- for example, those of political office

holders, soldiers, physicians, and lawyers - or confidential infor­

mation given under the seal of secrecy must be kep t, s ave in
exceptional cases where keeping the secret is bound to cause very

grave harm to the one who confided it, to the one who received it
or to a third party, and where the very grave harm can be avoided

only by divulging the truth. Even if not confided under the seal of
secrecy, private information prejudicial to another is not to be
divulged without a grave and proportionate reason.

2492

Everyone should observe an appropriate reserve concern-

2522

ing persons' private lives . Those in charge of communications

should maintain a fair balance between the requirements of the

common good and respect for individual rights. Interference by the
media in the private lives of persons engaged in political or public

activity is to be condemned to the extent that it infringes upon their

privacy and freedom.

V.

THE USE OF THE SOCIAL COMMUNICATIONS MEDIA

2493

Within modem society the communications media play a

major role

in information, cultural promotion, and formation. This

role is increasing, as a result of technological progress, the extent
and diversity of the news transmitted, and the influence exercised
on public opinion.

2494

The information provided by the media is at the service of

the common good .285 Society has a right to information based on

truth, freedom, justice, and solidarity:

The proper exercise of this right demands that the content
of the communication be true and - within the limits set by
justice and charity - complete. Further, it should be commu­
nicated honestly and properly. This means that in the gath­
ering and in the publication of news, the moral law and the
legitimate rights and dignity of man should be upheld. 286

285 Cf. IM 11.
286 IM 5 § 2.

1906

598

Part Three

906 2495

"It is necessary that all members of society meet the demands of
justice and charity in this domain. They should help, through the means
of social communication, in the formation and diffusion of sound public
opinion." 287 Solidarity is a consequence of genuine and right communi­
cation and the free circulation of ideas that further knowledge and respect
for others.

2496
2525

The means of social communication (especially the mass media)
can give rise to a certain passivity among users, making them less than
vigilant consumers of what is said or shown. Users should practice mod­
eration and discipline in their approach to the mass media. They will want
to form enlightened and correct consciences the more easily to resist
unwholesome influences.

2497

By the very nature of their profession, journalists have an obliga­
tion to serve the truth and not offend against charity in disseminating
information. They should strive to respect, with equal care, the nature of
the facts and the limits of critical judgment concerning individuals. They
should not stoop to defamation.

2237 2498
2286

1 903

"Civil a u th o rities have particular responsibilities in this field
because of the common good . . . . It is for the civil authority . . . to defend
and safeguard a true and just freedom of information." 288 By promulgating laws and overseeing their application, public authorities should ensure
that "public morality and social jrogress are not gravely endangered"
through misuse of the media. 28 Civil authorities should punish any
violation of the rights of individuals to their reputation and privacy. They
should give timely and reliable reports concerning the general good or
respond to the well-founded concerns of the people. Nothing can justify
recourse to disinformation for manipulating public opinion through the
media. Interventions by public authority should avoid injuring the free­
dom of individuals or groups.

2499
Moral judgment must condemn the plague of totalitarian states
which systematically falsify the truth, exercise political control of opinion
through the media, manipulate defendants and witnesses at public trials,
and imagine that they secure their tyranny by strangling and repressing
everything they consider "thought crimes."

TRUTH, BEAUTY, AND SACRED ART

2500
The practice of goodness is accompanied by spontaneous 1 804
spiritual joy and moral beauty. Likewise, truth carries with it the
joy and splendor of spiritual beauty. Truth is beautiful in itself.
Truth in words, the rational expression of the knowledge of created
and uncreated reality, is necessary to man, who is endowed with
intellect. But truth can also find other complementary forms of
human expression, above all when it is a matter of evoking what is
beyond words: the depths of the human heart, the exaltations of
the soul, the mystery of God. Even before revealing himself to man
in words of truth, God reveals himself to him through the universal
language of creation, the work of his Word, of his wisdom: the 341
order and harmony of the cosmos-which both the child and the
scientist discover-"from the greatness and beauty of created
things comes a corresponding perception of their Creator," "for the
author of beauty created them." 290
2 1 29
[Wisdom] is a breath of the power of God, and a pure
emanation of the glory of the Almighty; therefore nothing
defiled gains entrance into her. For she is a reflection of
eternal light, a spotless mirror of the working of God, and
an image of his goodness. 291 For [wisdom] is more beautiful
than the sun, and excels every constellation of the stars.
Compared with the light she is found to be superior, for it is
succeeded by the night, but against wisdom evil does not
prevaiL 292 I became enamored of her beauty. 293

2501
Created "in the image of God,"294 man also expresses the
truth of his relationship with God the Creator by the beauty of his
artistic works. Indeed, art is a distinctively human form of expres­
sion; beyond the search for the necessities of life which is common
to all living creatures, art is a freely given superabundance of the
human being's inne r riches. Arising from talent given by the Creator and from man's own effort, art is a form of practical wisdom,
uniting knowledge and ski11,295 to give form to the truth of reality
in a language accessible to sight or hearing. To the extent that it is
inspired by truth and love of beings, art bears a certain likeness to
God's activity in what he has created. Like any other human 339

Sacred art is

true and beau tiful when its form corresponds

to its particular vocation: evoking and glorifying, in faith and
adoration, the transcendent mystery of God - the surpassing invis­
ible beauty of truth and love visible in Christ, who "reflects the
glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature, " in whom "the

whole fullness of deity dwells bodily." 297 This spiritual beauty of
God is reflected in the most holy Virgin Mother of God, the angels,
and saints. Genuine sacred art draws man to adoration, to prayer,
and to the love of God, Creator and Savior, the Holy One and
Sanctifier.

2503

For this reason bishops, personally or through delegates,

should see to the promotion of sacred art, old and new, in all its
forms and, with the same religious care, remove from the liturgy
and from places of worship everything which is not in conformity

with the truth of faith and the au thentic beauty of sacred art. 298

IN BRIEF

"You shall not bear false witness against your neigh­
bor" (Ex 20:16) . Christ's disciples have "put on the new
man, created after the likeness of God in true right­
eousness and holiness"

(Eph 4:24) .

Truth or truthfulness is the virtue which consists in
showing oneself true in deeds and truthful in words,
and guarding against duplicity, dissimulation, and
hypocrisy.

2506

The Christian is not to "be ashamed of testifying to our
Lord"

(2 Tim 1 :8) in deed and word. Martyrdom is the

supreme witness given to the truth of the faith.

2507

Respect for the reputation and honor of persons for­

Lying consists in saying what is false with the inten­

THE NINTH COMMANDMENT
You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not
covet your neighbor's wife, or his manservant, or his maid­
servant, or his ox, or his ass, or anything that is your neigh­
bor's. 299
Every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already
committed adultery with her in his heart.300

377, 400 2514

St. John distinguishes three kinds of covetousness or concupiscence: lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and pride of life.301 In
the Catholic catechetical tradition, the ninth commandment forbids
carnal concupiscence; the tenth forbids coveting another's goods.

405 2515

Etymologically, "concupiscence" can refer to any intense
form of human desire . Christian theology has given it a particular
meaning: the movement of the sensitive appetite contrary to the
operation of the human reason. The apostle St. Paul identifies it
with the rebellion of the "flesh" against the "spirit."302 Concupis­
cence stems from the disobedience of the first sin. It unsettles man's
moral faculties and, without being in itself an offense, inclines man
to commit sins .303

362 2516

Because man is a composite being, spirit and body, there
already exists a certain tension in him; a certain struggle of tenden­
cies between "spirit" and "flesh" develops. But in fact this struggle
belongs to the heritage of sin. It is a consequence of sin and at the
same time a confirmation of it. It is part of the daily experience of
407 the spiritual battle:
For the Apostle it is not a matter of despising and condemn­
ing the body which with the spiritual soul constitutes man's
nature and personal subjectivity. Rather, he is concerned
with the morally good or bad works, or better, the permanent
dispositions - virtues and vices - which are the fruit of
submission (in the first case) or of resistance (in the second
case) to the saving action of the Holy Spirit. For this reason the
Apostle writes: "If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by
the Spirit."3 04

PURIFICATION OF THE HEART

368 2517

The heart is the seat of moral personality: "Out of the heart
come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication . . . . "305 The
struggle against carnal covetousness entails purifying the heart
1809 and practicing temperance:

301 Cf. 1 Jn 2:16.
302 Cf. Gal 5:16, 17, 24; Eph 2:3.
303 Cf. Gen 3:11; Council of Trent: DS 1515.

Life in Christ
Remain simple and innocent, and you will be like little
children who do not know the evil that destroys man's
life.306

2518
The sixth beatitude proclaims, "Blessed are the pure in
heart, for they shall see God."307 "Pure in heart" refers to those who
have attuned their intellects and wills to the demands of God's
holiness, chiefly in three areas: charity;308 chastity or sexual recti­
tude;309 love of truth and orthodoxy of faith.310 There is a connec94
tion between purity of heart, of body, and of faith:
The faithful must believe the articles of the Creed "so that
by believing they may obey God, by obeying may live well,
by living well may purify their hearts, and with pure hearts
may understand what they believe. " 311

158

2519

The "pure in heart" are promised that they will see God 2548
face to face and be like him. 312 Purity of heart is the precondition
of the vision of God . Even now it enables us to see according to God,
to accept others as "neighbors"; it lets us perceive the human body 2819
- ours and our neighbor's - as a temple of the Holy Spirit, a
2501
manifestation of divine beauty.

THE BATILE FOR PURITY

Baptism confers on its recipient the grace of purification 1264
from all sins. But the baptized must continue to struggle against
concupiscence of the flesh and disordered desires. With God's
grace he will prevail

- by the virtue and gift of chastity, for chastity lets us love with 2337
upright and undivided heart;
- by purity ofinten tion which consists in seeking the true end of man: 1 752

and imagination; by refusing all complicity in impure thoughts that
incline us to turn aside from the path of God's commandments:
"Appearance arouses yearning in fools";314

2846 - by prayer:
I thought that continence arose from one's own powers,
which I did not recognize in myself. I was foolish enough
not to know . . . that no one can be continent unless you grant
it. For you would surely have granted it if my inner groaning
had reached your ears and I with firm faith had cast my cares
on you. 315

2521

Purity requires modesty, an integral part of temperance.
Modesty protects the intimate center of the person. It means refus­
ing to unveil what should remain hidden. It is ordered to chastity
to whose sensitivity it bears witness. It guides how one looks at
others and behaves toward them in conformity with the dignity of
persons and their solidarity.

2492 2522

Modesty protects the mystery of persons and their love. It
encourages patience and moderation in loving relationships; it
requires that the conditions for the definitive giving and commit­
ment of man and woman to one another be fulfilled. Modesty is
decency. It inspires one's choice of clothing. It keeps silence or
reserve where there is evident risk of unhealthy curiosity. It is
discreet.

2354 2523

There is a modesty of the feelings as well as of the body. It
protests, for example, against the voyeuristic explorations of the human
body in certain advertisements, or against the solicitations of certain media
that go too far in the exhibition of intimate things. Modesty inspires a way
of life which makes it possible to resist the allurements of fashion and the
pressures of prevailing ideologies.

2524

The forms taken by modesty vary from one culture to another.
Everywhere, however, modesty exists as an intuition of the spiritual
dignity proper to man. It is born with the awakening consciousness of
being a subject. Teaching modesty to children and adolescents means
awakening in them respect for the human person.

Christian purity requires a purification of the social climate.
It requires of the communications media that their presentations
show concern for respect and restraint. Purity of heart brings
freedom from widespread eroticism and avoids entertainment
inclined to voyeurism and ill us ion.

2344

2526
So-called moral permissiveness rests on an erroneous conception of human freedom; the necessary precondition for the
development of true freedom is to let oneself be educated in the
moral law. Those in charge of education can reasonably be ex­
pected to give young people instruction respectful of the truth, the
qualities of the heart, and the moral and spiritual dignity of man.

2527
"The Good News of Christ continually renews the life and
culture of fallen man; it combats and removes the error and evil
which flow from the ever-present attraction of sin. It never ceases
to purify and elevate the morality of peoples. It takes the spiritual
qualities and endowments of every age and nation, and with
supernatural riches it causes them to blossom, as it were, from
within; it fortifies, completes, and restores them in Christ."31 6

2532

Purification of the heart demands prayer, the practice

anything that is your neighbor's. 17
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.318

2534

The tenth commandment unfolds and completes the ninth,

which is concerned with concupiscence of the flesh. It forbids
coveting the goods of another, as the root of theft, robbery, and
fraud, which the seventh commandment forbids. "Lust of the eyes"
leads to the violence and injustice forbidden by the fifth command­
ment. 319 Avarice, like fornication, originates in the idolatry prohib­

ited by the firs t three prescrip tions of the Law. 320 The tenth

ourselves when we are cold. These desires are good in themselves;
but often they exceed the limits of reason and drive us to covet
unjustly what is not ours and belongs to another or is owed to him.

2536

The tenth commandment forbids

greed and the desire to
avarice arising from a

2445 passion for riches and their attendant power. It also forbids the
desire to commit injustice by harming our neighbor

in his temporal

goods:

When the Law says, "You shall not covet," these words
mean that we should banish our desires for whatever does
not belong to us. Our thirst for another's goods is immense,
infinite, never quenched. Thus it is written: "He who loves
money never has money enough." 321

2537

It is not a violation of this commandment to desire to
ob tain things that belong to one's neighbor, provided this is done
by just means. Traditional catechesis realistically mentions "those
who have a harder struggle against their criminal desires" and so
who "must be urged the more to keep this commandment":
. . . merchants who desire scarcity and rising prices, who
cannot bear not to be the only ones buying and selling so that
they themselves can sell more dearly and buy more cheaply;
those who hope that their peers will be impoverished, in
order to realize a profit either by selling to them or buying
from them . . . physicians who wish disease to spread;
lawyers who are eager for many important cases and tri­
als. 3 22

2538

The tenth commandment requires that envy be banished 231 7
from the human heart. When the prophet Nathan wanted to spur
King David to repentance, he told him the story about the poor man
who had only one ewe lamb that he treated like his own daughter
and the rich man who, despite the great number of his flocks,
envied the poor man and ended by stealing his lamb . 323 Envy can
lead to the worst crimes.324 "Through the devil's envy death en391
tered the world": 325
We fight one another, and envy arms us against one an­
other . . . . If everyone strives to unsettle the Body of Christ,
where shall we end up? We are engaged in making Christ's
Body a corpse . . . . We declare ourselves members of one and
the same organism, yet we devour one another like
beasts. 326

Envy is a capital sin. It refers to the sadness at the sight of 1 866
another's goods and the immoderate desire to acquire them for
oneself, even unjustly. When it wishes grave harm to a neighbor it
is a mortal sin:

2539

St. Augustine saw envy as "the diabolical sin." 327 "From
envy are born hatred, detraction, calumny, joy caused by the
misfortune of a neighbor, and displeasure caused by his
prosperity." 328

should train himsel f to live in hu mility:

Would you like to see God glorified by you? Then rejoice in
your brother's progress and you will immediately give glory
to God. Because his servant could conquer envy by rejoicing
in the merits of others, God will be praised. 32g

THE DESIRES OF THE SPIRIT

2541

The economy of law and grace turns men's hearts away

from avarice and envy. It initiates them into desire for the Sover-

eign Good; it instructs them in the desires of the Holy Spirit who

satisfies man's heart.

The God of the p romises always warned man against

seduction by what from the beginning has seemed "good for food
. . . a delight to the eyes . . . to be desired to make one wise :mo

1 963 2542

The Law entrusted to Israel never sufficed to justify those

subject to it; it even became the instrument of "lust." 331 The gap

between wanting and doing points to the conflict between God's

Law which is the "law of my mind," and another law "making me
captive to the law of sin which dwells in my members . " 332

1 992 2543

"But now the righteousness of God has been manifested

apart from law, although the law and the p rophets bear witness to

it, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who

believe ." 333 Henceforth, Christ's faithful "have crucified the flesh
with its passions and desires"; they are led by the Spirit and follow
the desires of the Spirit.334

POVERTY OF HEART

2544
Jesus enjoins his disciples to prefer him to everything and
everyone, and bids them "renounce all that [they have]" for his
sake and that of the Gospei. 335 Shortly before his passion he gave
them the example of the poor widow of Jerusalem who, out of her
poverty, gave all that she had to live on.336 The precept of detach­
ment from riches is obligatory for entrance into the Kingdom of
heaven.

544

2545
All Christ's faithful are to "direct their affections rightly,
lest they be hindered in their pursuit of perfect charity by the use
of worldly things and by an adherence to riches which is contrary
to the spirit of evangelical poverty."337

2013

2546
"Blessed are the poor in spirit."338 The Beatitudes reveal
an order of happiness and grace, of beauty and peace. Jesus cele­
brates the joy of the poor, to whom the Kingdom already be- 1 71 6
longs:339
The Word speaks of voluntary humility as "poverty in
spirit"; the Apostle gives an example of God's poverty when
he says: "For your sakes he became poor. "340

2547
The Lord grieves over the rich, because they find their
consolation in the abundance of goods.341 "Let the proud seek and
love earthly kingdoms, but blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs
is the Kingdom of heaven."342 Abandonment to the providence of
the Father in heaven frees us from anxiety about tomorrow. 343
Trust in God is a preparation for the blessedness of the poor. They
shall see God.

Desire for true happiness frees man from his immoderate
attachment to the goods of this world so that he can find his
251 9 fulfillment in the vision and beatitude of God. "The promise [of
seeing God] surpasses all beatitude . . . . In Scripture, to see is to
possess . . . . Whoever sees God has obtained all the goods of which
he can conceive. "344

2549

It remains for the holy people to struggle, with grace from
on high, to obtain the good things God promises. In order to
2015 possess and contemplate God, Christ's faithful mortify their crav­
ings and, with the grace of G od, prevail over the seductions of
pleasure and power.

2550
On this way of perfection, the Spirit and the Bride call
whoever hears them345 to perfect communion with God:
There will true glory be, where no one will be praised by
mistake or flattery; true honor will not be refused to the
worthy, nor granted to the unworthy; likewise, no one un­
worthy will pretend to be worthy, where only those who are
worthy will be admitted. There true peace will reign, where
no one will experience opposition either from self or others.
God himself will be virtue's reward; he gives virtue and has
promised to give himself as the best and greatest reward that
could exist. .
"I shall be their God and they will be my
people . . . . " This is also the meaning of the Apostle's words:
"So that God may be all in all." God himself will be the goal
of our desires; we shall contemplate him without end, love him
without surfeit, praise him without weariness. This gift, this
state, this act, like eternal life itself, will assuredly be common
to all 34 6

Constantinople in about the year 1059.
Christ turns in prayer towards the Father (cf. §2599). He prays alone, in a deserted
place. His disciples look on from a respectful distance. St. Peter, the head of the
apostles, turns towards the others and points toh im who is the Master and the
Way of Christian prayer (cf. §2607): "Lord, teach us to pray" (Lk 1 1 :1).

PART FOUR
CHRISTIAN PRAYER
SECTION ONE
PRAYER IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE
2558
"Great is the mystery of the faith!" The Church professes
this mystery in the Apostles' Creed (Part One) and celebrates it in
the sacramental liturgy (Part Two), so that the life of the faithful
may be conformed to Christ in the Holy Spirit to the glory of God
the Father (Part Three). This mystery, then, requires that the faithful
believe in it, that they celebrate it, and that they live from it in a
vital and personal relationship with the living and true God. This
relationship is prayer.

WHAT I s P RAYER ?
For me, prayer is a surge of the heart; it is a simple look
turned toward heaven, it is a cry of recognition and of love,
embracing both trial and joy. l

Prayer as God's gift
2559
"Prayer is the raising of one's mind and heart to God or
the requesting of good things from God." 2 But when we pray, do
we speak from the height of our pride and will, or "out of the
depths" of a humble and contrite heart?3 He who humbles himself
will be exalted;4 humility is the foundation of prayer. Only when 2613
we humbly acknowledge that "we do not know how to pray as we 2763

ought/'s are we ready to receive freely the gift of prayer. "Man is
a beggar before God." 6

2560
"If you knew the gift of God!" 7 The wonder of prayer is
revealed beside the well where we come seeking water: there,
Christ comes to meet every human being. It is he who first seeks
us and asks us for a drink. Jesus thirsts; his asking arises from the
depths of God's desire for us. Whether we realize it or not, prayer
is the encounter of God's thirst with ours. God thirsts that we may
thirst for him.8
2561
"You would have asked him, and he would have given
you living water." 9 Paradoxically our prayer of petition is a re­
sponse to the plea of the living God: "They have forsaken me, the
fountain of living waters, and hewn out cisterns for themselves,
broken cisterns that can hold no water! " 10 Prayer is the response
of faith to the free promise of salvation and also a response of love
to the thirst of the only Son of God. 11

Prayer as covenant
2562
Where does prayer come from? Whether prayer is ex­
pressed in words or gestures, it is the whole man who prays. But
in naming the source of prayer, Scripture speaks sometimes of the
soul or the spirit, but most often of the heart (more than a thousand
times). According to Scripture, it is the heart that prays. If our heart
is far from God, the words of prayer are in vain.
2563
The heart is the dwelling-place where I am, where I live;
according to the Semitic or Biblical expression, the heart is the place
"to which I withdraw." The heart is our hidden center, beyond the
grasp of our reason and of others; only the Spirit of God can fathom
the human heart and know it fully. The heart is the place of
decision, deeper than our psychic drives. It is the place of truth,
2699 where we choose life or death. It is the place of encounter, because
1 696 as image of God we live in relation: it is the place of covenant.

2564
Christian prayer is a covenant relationship between God
and man in Christ. It is the action of God and of man, springing
forth from both the Holy Spirit and ourselves, wholly directed to
the Father, in union with the human will of the Son of God made
man.
Prayer as communion
2565
In the New Covenant, prayer is the living relationship of
the children of God with their Father who is good beyond measure,
with his Son Jesus Christ and with the Holy Spirit. The grace of the
Kingdom is "the union of the entire holy and royal Trinity . . . with 260
the whole human spirit. " 12 Thus, the life of prayer is the habit of
being in the presence of the thrice-holy God and in communion
with him. This communion of life is always possible because,
through Baptism, we have already been united with Christ. 1 3
Prayer is Christian insofar as it is communion with Christ and
extends throughout the Church, which is his Body. Its dimensions
are those of Christ's love. 14

THE REVELATION OF P RAYER

THE UNIVERSAL CALL TO PRAYER

2566
Man is in search of God. In the act of creation, God calls every
being from nothingness into existence. "Crowned with glory and
296 honor," man is, after the angels, capable of acknowledging "how
majestic is the name of the Lord in all the earth." 1 Even after losing
through his sin his likeness to God, man remains an image of his
355 Creator, and retains the desire for the one who calls him into existence.
28 All religions bear witness to men's essential search for God.2
2567
God calls man first. Man may forget his Creator or hide far
from his face; he may run after idols or accuse the deity of having
abandoned him; yet the living and true God tirelessly calls each
30 person to that mysterious encounter known as prayer. In prayer,
the faithful God's initiative of love always comes first; our own first
step is always a response. As God gradually reveals himself and
142 reveals man to himself, prayer appears as a reciprocal call, a
covenant drama. Through words and actions, this drama engages
the heart. It unfolds throughout the whole history of salvation.

ARTICLE 1
IN THE OLD TESTAMENT

2568
In the Old Testament, the revelation of prayer comes be­
tween the fall and the restoration of man, that is, between God's
410 sorrowful call to his first children: "Where are you? . . . What is this
1 736 that you have done?"3 and the response of God's only Son on
coming into the world: "Lo, I have come to do your will, 0 God." 4
Prayer is bound up with human history, for it is the relationship
2738 with God in historical events.

Creation - source of prayer

2569
Prayer is lived in the first place beginning with the realities 288
of creation. The first nine chapters of Genesis describe this relationship with God as an offering of the first-born of Abel's flock, as the
invocation of the divine name at the time of Enosh, and as "walking
with God." 5 Noah's offering is pleasing to God, who blesses him 58
and through him all creation, because his heart was upright and
undivided; Noah, like Enoch before him, "walks with God." 6 This
kind of prayer is lived by many righteous people in all religions.

In his indefectible covenant with every living creature,? God
has always called people to prayer. But it is above all beginning with 59
our father Abraham that prayer is revealed in the Old Testament.
God's promise and the prayer of Faith

2570
When God calls him, Abraham goes forth " as the Lord had
told him" ;8 Abraham's heart is entirely submissive to the Word and
so he obeys. Such attentiveness of the heart, whose decisions are 145
made according to God's will, is essential to prayer, while the
words used count only in relation to it. Abraham's prayer is
expressed first by deeds: a man of silence, he constructs an altar to
the Lord at each stage of his journey. Only later does Abraham's
first prayer in words appear: a veiled complaint reminding God of
his promises which seem unfulfilled. 9 Thus one aspect of the
drama of prayer appears from the beginning: the test of faith in the
fidelity of God.
Because Abraham believed in God and walked in his
presence and in covenant with him, t o the patriarch is ready to
welcome a mysterious Guest into his tent. Abraham's remarkable
hospitality at Mamre foreshadows the annunciation of the true Son 494
of the promise.ll After that, once God had confided his plan,
Abraham's heart is attuned to his Lord's compassion for men and
2635
he dares to intercede for them with bold confidence.l 2

As a final stage in the purification of his faith, Abraham,
"who had received the promises," 13 is asked to sacrifice the son
God had given him. Abraham's faith does not weaken ("God
himself will provide the lamb for a burnt offering."), for he "con­
sidered that God was able to raise men even from the dead . " 14 And
so the father of believers is conformed to the likeness of the Father
who will not spare his own Son but will deliver him up for us alLIS
Prayer restores man to God's likeness and enables him to share in
the power of God's love that saves the multitude. l 6

God renews his promise to Jacob, the ancestor of the twelve
tribes of IsraelP Before confronting his elder brother Esau, Jacob
wrestles all night with a mysterious figure who refuses to reveal his
name, but who blesses him before leaving him at dawn. From this
account, the spiritual tradition of the Church has retained the symbol
of prayer as a battle of faith and as the triumph of perseverance. 18

2573

Moses and the prayer of the mediator
Once the promise begins to be fulfilled (Passover, the
Exodus, the gift of the Law, and the ratification of the covenant),
the prayer of Moses becomes the most striking example of inter­
cessory prayer, which will be fulfilled in "the one mediator be­
tween God and men, the man Christ Jesus." 19

2574

62

Here again the initiative is God's. From the midst of the
burning bush he calls Moses. 20 This event will remain one of the
primordial images of prayer in the spiritual tradition of Jews and
Christians alike. When "the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob"
calls Moses to be his servant, it is because he is the living God who
wants men to live. God reveals himself in order to save them, though
he does not do this alone or despite them: he calls Moses to be his
messenger, an associate in his compassion, his work of salvation.
There is something of a divine plea in this mission, and only after long
debate does Moses attune his own will to that of the Savior God. But
in the dialogue in which God confides in him, Moses also learns how
to pray: he balks, makes excuses, above all questions: and it is in

response to his question that the Lord confides his ineffable name,
which will be revealed through his mighty deeds.

2576

"Thus the LORD used to speak to Moses face to face, as a 555
man speaks to his friend."21 Moses' prayer is characteristic of
contemplative prayer by which God's servant remains faithful to
his mission. Moses converses with God often and at length, climbing the mountain to hear and entreat him and coming down to the
people to repeat the words of his God for their guidance. Moses "is
entrusted with all my house. With him I speak face to face, clearly,
not in riddles," for "Moses was very humble, more so than anyone
else on the face of the earth."22

2577
From this intimacy with the faithful God, slow to anger
and abounding in steadfast love,23 Moses drew strength and deter­
mination for his intercession. He does not pray for himself but for 2 1 0
the people whom God made his own. Moses already intercedes for
them during the battle with the Arnalekites and prays to obtain
healing for Miriam. 24 But it is chiefly after their apostasy that Moses 2635
"stands in the breach" before God in order to save the people. 25
The arguments of his prayer - for intercession is also a mysterious
battle - will inspire the boldness of the great intercessors among
the Jewish people and in the Church: God is love; he is therefore
righteous and faithful; he cannot contradict himself; he must re- 214
member his marvellous deeds, since his glory i s a t s take, and he
cannot forsake this people that bears his name.
David and the prayer of the king

2578

The prayer of the People of God flourishes in the shadow
of God's dwelling place, first the ark of the covenant and later the
Temple. At first the leaders of the people - the shepherds and the
prophets - teach them to pray. The infant Samuel must have
learned from his mother Hannah how "to stand before the LORD"
and from the priest Eli how to listen to his word: "Speak, LORD, for
your servant is listening. "26 Later, he will also know the cost and
consequence of intercession: "Moreover, as for me, far be it from
me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pr for you;
and I will instruct you in the good and the right way."2

David is par excellence the king "after God's own heart,"
the shepherd who prays for his people and prays in their name.
His submission to the will of God, his praise, and his repentance,
will be a model for the prayer of the people. His prayer, the prayer
of God's Anointed, is a faithful adherence to the divine promise
and expresses a loving and joyful trust in God, the only King and
Lord. 28 In the Psalms David, inspired by the Holy Spirit, is the first
prophet of Jewish and Christian prayer. The prayer of Christ, the
true Messiah and Son of David, will reveal and fulfill the meaning
of this prayer.

709 2579

436

The Temple of Jerusalem, the house of prayer that David
wanted to build, will be the work of his son, Solomon. The prayer
at the dedication of the Temple relies on God's promise and cove­
nant, on the active presence of his name among his People, recall­
ing his mighty deeds at the Exodus. 29 The king lifts his hands
toward heaven and begs the Lord, on his own behalf, on behalf of
the entire people, and of the generations yet to come, for the
forgiveness of their sins and for their daily needs, so that the
nations may know that He is the only God and that the heart of his
people may belong wholly and entirely to him.

583 2580

Elijah, the prophets and conversion of heart
For the People of God, the Temple was to be the place of
their education in prayer: pilgrimages, feasts and sacrifices, the
evening offering, the incense, and the bread of the Presence
("shewbread") - all these signs of the holiness and glory of God
Most High and Most Near were appeals to and ways of prayer. But
ritualism often encouraged an excessively external worship. The
people needed education in faith and conversion of heart; this was
the mission of the prophets, both before and after the Exile.

Elijah is the "father" of the prophets, "the generation of
those who seek him, who seek the face of the God of Jacob . " 30
Elijah's name, "The Lord is my God," foretells the people's cry in
response to his prayer on Mount Carmel. 31 St. James refers to Elijah
in order to encourage us to pray: "The prayer of the righteous is
powerful and effective." 32

After Elijah had learned mercy during his retreat at the
Wadi Cherith, he teaches the widow of Zarephath to believe in The
Word of God and confirms her faith by his urgent prayer: God
brings the widow's child back to life. 33
The sacrifice on Mount Carmel is a decisive test for the
faith of the People of God. In response to Elijah's plea, "Answer
me, 0 LORD, answer me," the Lord's fire consumes the holocaust, 696
at the time of the evening oblation. The Eastern liturgies repeat
Elijah's plea in the Eucharistic epiclesis.
Finally, taking the desert road that leads to the place where
the living and true God reveals himself to his people, Elijah, like
Moses before him, hides "in a cleft of the rock" until the mysterious
presence of God has passed by. 34 But only on the mountain of the
Transfiguration will Moses and Elijah behold the unveiled face of 555
him whom they sought; "the light of the knowledge of the glory of
God [shines] in the face of Christ," crucified and risen. 35

2584
In their "one to one" encounters with God, the prophets 2 709
draw light and strength for their mission. Their prayer is not flight
from this unfaithful world, but rather attentiveness to The Word
of God. At times their prayer is an argument or a complaint, but it
is always an intercession that awaits and prepares for the intervention of the Savior God, the Lord of history. 36
The Psalms, the prayer of the assembly
2585
From the time of David to the coming of the Messiah texts
appearing in these sacred books show a deepening in prayer for
oneself and in prayer for others.37 Thus the psalms were gradually 1093
collected into the five books of the Psalter (or "Praises"), the
masterwork of prayer in the Old Testament.
2586
The Psalms both nourished and expressed the prayer of
the People of God gathered during the great feasts at Jerusalem and
each Sabbath in the synagogues. Their prayer is inseparably per­
sonal and communal; it concerns both those who are praying and
all men. The Psalms arose from the communities of the Holy Land
and the Diaspora, but embrace all creation. Their prayer recalls the
saving events of the past, yet extends into the future, even to the

end of history; it commemorates the promises God has already
kept, and awaits the Messiah who will fulfill them definitively.
Prayed by Christ and fulfilled in him, the Psalms remain essential
1 1 77 to the prayer of the Church.38

2587
The Psalter is the book in which The Word of God becomes
man's prayer. In other books of the Old Testament, "the words
proclaim [God's] works and bring to light the mystery they con­
tain. " 39 The words of the Psalmist, sung for God, both express and
acclaim the Lord's saving works; the same Spirit inspires both
God's work and man's response. Christ will unite the two . In him,
2641 the psalms continue to teach us how to pray.
The Psalter's many forms of prayer take shape both in the
liturgy of the Temple and in the human heart. Whether hymns or
prayers of lamentation or thanksgiving, whether individual or
communal, whether royal chants, songs of pilgrimage or wisdom­
meditations, the Psalms are a mirror of God's marvelous deeds in
the history of his people, as well as reflections of the human
experiences of the Psalmist. Though a given psalm may reflect an
event of the past, it still possesses such direct simplicity that it can
be prayed in truth by men of all times and conditions.
2588

2589
Certain constant characteristics appear throughout the
Psalms: simplicity and spontaneity of prayer; the desire for God
himself through and with all that is good in his creation; the
distraught situation of the believer who, in his preferential love for
the Lord, is exposed to a host of enemies and temptations, but who
waits upon what the faithful God will do, in the certitude of his
304 love and in submission to his will. The prayer of the psalms is always
sustained by praise; that is why the title of this collection as handed
down to us is so fitting: "The Praises." Collected for the assembly's
worship, the Psalter both sounds the call to prayer and sings the
response to that call: Hallelu-Yah! ("Alleluia"), "Praise the Lord!"

What is more pleasing than a psalm? David expresses i t well:
"Praise the Lord, for a psalm is good: let there be praise of
our God with gladness and grace!" Yes, a psalm is a blessing
on the lips of the people, praise of God, the assembly's
homage, a general acclamation, a word that speaks for all,
the voice of the Church, a confession of faith in song. 40

Christian Prayer

IN BRIEF

2590

"Prayer is the raising of one's mind and heart to God
or the requesting of good things from God" (St. John
Damascene, De fide orth. 3, 24: PG 94, 1089C).

2591

God tirelessly calls each person to this mysterious
encounter with Himself. Prayer unfolds throughout
the whole history of salvation as a reciprocal call be­
tween God and man.

2592

The prayer of Abraham and Jacob is presented as a battle
of faith marked by trust in God's faithfulness and by
certitude in the victory promised to perseverance.

2593

The prayer of Moses responds to the living God's
initiative for the salvation of his people. It foreshad­
ows the prayer of intercession of the unique mediator,
Christ Jesus.

2594

The prayer of the People of God flourished in the
shadow of the dwelling place of God's presence on
earth, the ark of the covenant and the Temple, under
the guidance of their shepherds, especially King
David, and of the prophets.

2595

The prophets summoned the people to conversion of
heart and, while zealously seeking the face of God, like
Elijah, they interceded for the people.

2596

The Psalms constitute the masterwork of prayer in the
Old Testament. They present two inseparable quali­
ties: the personal, and the communal. They extend to
all dimensions of history, recalling God's promises
already fulfilled and looking for the coming of the
Messiah.

2597

Prayed and fulfilled in Christ, the Psalms are an essential
and permanent element of the prayer of the Church.
They are suitable for men of every condition and time.

ARTICLE 2
IN THE FULLNESS OF TIME
2598
The drama of prayer is fully revealed to us in the Word
who became flesh and dwells among us. To seek to understand his
prayer through what his witnesses proclaim to us in the Gospel is
to approach the holy Lord Jesus as Moses approached the burning
bush: first to contemplate him in prayer, then to hear how he
teaches us to pray, in order to know how he hears our prayer.

Jesus prays
The Son of God who became Son of the Virgin also learned
to pray according to his human heart. He learns the formulas of
prayer from his mother, who kept in her heart and meditated upon
all the " great things" done by the Almighty.41 He learns to pray in
the words and rhythms of the prayer of his people, in the synagogue at Nazareth and the Temple at Jerusalem. But his prayer
springs from an otherwise secret source, as he intimates at the age
of twelve: "I must be in my Father's house."42 Here the newness of
prayer in the fullness of time begins to be revealed: his filial prayer,
which the Father awaits from his children, is finally going to be
lived out by the only Son in his humanity, with and for men.

The Gospel according to St. Luke emphasizes the action of
the Holy Spirit and the meaning of prayer in Christ's ministry.
Jesus prays before the decisive moments of his mission: before his
554 Father's witness to him during his baptism and Transfiguration,
and before his own fulfillment of the Father's plan of love by his
612 Passion.43 He also prays before the decisive moments involving the
mission of his apostles: at his election and call of the Twelve, before
443 Peter's confession of him as "the Christ of God," and again that the
faith of the chief of the Apostles may not fail when tempted. 44 Jesus'
prayer before the events of salvation that the Father has asked him
to fulfill is a humble and trusting commitment of his human will
to the loving will of the Father.

Christian Prayer

625

2601
"He was praying in a certain place and when he had
ceased, one of his disciples said to him, 'Lord, teach us to pray."'45
In seeing the Master at prayer the disciple of Christ also wants to
pray. By contemplating and hearing the Son, the master of prayer,
the children learn to pray to the Father.
2765
2602
Jesus often draws apart to pray in solitude, on a mountain,
preferably at night. 46 He includes all men in his prayer, for he has
taken on humanity in his incarnation, and he offers them to the 616
Father when he offers himself. Jesus, the Word who has become
flesh, shares by his human prayer in all that "his brethren" experience; he sympathizes with their weaknesses in order to free them. 47
It was for this that the Father sent him. His words and works are
the visible manifestation of his prayer in secret.
2603
The evangelists have preserved two more explicit prayers
offered by Christ during his public ministry. Each begins with thanks­
giving. In the first, Jesus confesses the Father, acknowledges, and 2673
blesses him because he has hidden the mysteries of the Kingdom from
those who think themselves learned and has revealed them to infants,
the poor of the Beatitudes.48 His exclamation, "Yes, Father!" expresses 2546
the depth of his heart, his adherence to the Father's "good pleasure,"
echoing his mother's Fiat at the time of his conception and prefiguring 494
what he will say to the Father in his agony. The whole prayer of Jesus
is contained in this loving adherence of his human heart to the
mystery of the will of the Father.49
2604
The second prayer, before the raising of Lazarus, is re­
corded by St. John.50 Thanksgiving precedes the event: "Father, I
thank you for having heard me," which implies that the Father
always hears his petitions. Jesus immediately adds: "I know that
you always hear me," which implies that Jesus, on his part, con­
stantly made such petitions. Jesus' prayer, characterized by thanks­
giving, reveals to us how to ask: before the gift is given, Jesus
commits himself to the One who in giving gives himself. The Giver
is more precious than the gift; he is the "treasure"; in him abides
478
his Son's heart; the gift is given "as well."51

Part Four

The f riestly prayer of Jesus holds a unique place in the economy
of salva tion. 5 A medita tion on it will conclude Section One. It reveals the
ever present prayer of our High Priest and, at the same time, contains what
he teaches us about our prayer to our Father, which will be developed in
Section Two.

2605
When the hour had come for him to fulfill the Father's plan
of love, Jesus allows a glimpse of the boundless depth of his filial
prayer, not only before he freely delivered himself up ("Abba . . . not
my wilt but yours."),53 but even in his last words on the Cross, where
prayer and the gift of self are but one: "Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do" f54 "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with
me in Paradise" ['5 "Woman, behold your son" - "Behold your
mother"f>6 "I thirst."P "My God, My God, why have you forsaken
me?"f>S "It is finished"f>9 "Father, into your hands I commit my
spirit!"60 until the "loud cry" as he expires, giving up his spirit.61
All the troubles, for all time, of humanity enslaved by sin
and death, all the petitions and intercessions of salvation history
are summed up in this cry of the incarnate Word. Here the Father
accepts them and, beyond all hope, answers them by raising his
Son. Thus is fulfilled and brought to completion the drama of
prayer in the economy of creation and salvation. The Psalter gives
us the key to prayer in Christ. In the "today" of the Resurrection
the Father says: "You are my Son, today I have begotten you. Ask
of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of
the earth your possession. " 62

The Letter to the Hebrews expresses in dramatic terms how the
prayer of Jesus accomplished the victory of salvation: "In the
days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications,
with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him
from death, and he was heard for his godly fear. Although
he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suf­
fered, and being made perfect, he became the source of
eternal salvation to all who obey him . 63

Christian Prayer

Jesus teaches us how to pray

2607
When Jesus prays he is already teaching us how to pray. 520
His prayer to his Father is the theologal path (the path of faith,
hope, and charity) of our prayer to God. But the Gospel also gives
us Jesus' explicit teaching on prayer. Like a wise teacher he takes
hold of us where we are and leads us progressively toward the
Father. Addressing the crowds following him, Jesus builds on what
they already know of prayer from the Old Covenant and opens to
them the newness of the coming Kingdom. Then he reveals this
newness to them in parables. Finally, he will speak openly of the
Father and the Holy Spirit to his disciples who will be the teachers
of prayer in his Church.
2608
From the Sermon on the Mount onwards, Jesus insists on 541
conversion of heart: reconciliation with one's brother before present- 1430
ing an offering on the altar, love of enemies, and prayer for perse­
cutors, prayer to the Father in secret, not heaping up empty
phrases, prayerful forgiveness from the depths of the heart, purity
of heart, and seeking the Kingdom before all else. 64 This filial
conversion is entirely directed to the Father.

2609
Once committed to conversion, the heart learns to pray in 153
faith. Faith is a filial adherence to God beyond what we feel and 1 814
understand . I t i s possible because the beloved Son gives u s access
to the Father. He can ask us to "seek" and to "knock," since he
himself is the door and the way. 65

2610 Just as Jesus prays to the Father and gives thanks before
receiving his gifts, so he teaches us filial boldness: "Whatever you
ask in prayer, believe that you receive it, and you will. " 66 Such is
the power of prayer and of faith that does not doubt: "all things are
possible to him who believes." 67 Jesus is as saddened by the "lack
of faith" of his own neighbors and the "little faith" of his own 1 65
disciples68 as he is struck with admiration at the great faith of the
Roman centurion and the Canaanite woman. 69
The prayer of faith consists not only in saying "Lord,
Lord," but in disposing the heart to do the will of the Father?O Jesus 2827

calls his disciples to bring into their prayer this concern for coop­
erating with the divine plan. 71

In Jesus

2612

"the Kingdom of God is at hand . " 72 He calls his

hearers to conversion and faith, but also to

672

watchfulness. In prayer

the disciple keeps watch, attentive to Him Who Is and Him Who
Comes, in memory of his first coming in the lowliness of the flesh,
and in the hope of his second coming in glory?3 In communion

2725

with their Master, the disciples' prayer is a battle; only by keeping
watch in prayer can one avoid falling into temptation?4

546 2613

Three principal parables on prayer are transmitted to us by St.

Luke:

- The first, "the importunate friend," 75 invites us to urgent prayer: "Knock,
and it will be opened to you." To the one who prays like this, the heavenly
Father will "give whatever he needs," and above all the Holy Spirit who
contains all gifts.
- The second, "the importunate widow," 76 is centered on one of the
qualities of prayer: it is necessary to pray always without ceasing and with
the patience of faith. "And yet, when the Son of Man comes, will he find
faith on earth?"

2559

- The third parable, "the Pharisee and the tax collector," 77 concerns the
humility of the heart that prays. "God, be merciful to me a sinner!" The
Church continues to make this prayer its own: Kyrie eleison !

2614

When Jesus openly entrusts to his disciples the mystery of

prayer to the Father, he reveals to them what their prayer and ours

434

must be, once he has returned to the Father in his glorified humanity. What is new is to "ask in his name " 78 Faith in the Son introduces
.

the disciples into the knowledge of the Father, because Jesus is "the
way, and the truth, and the life." 79 Faith bears its fruit in love: it
means keeping the word and the commandments of Jesus, it means
abiding with

629

Even more, what the Father gives us when our prayer is

728

united with that of Jesus is "another Counselor, to be with you for
ever, even the Spirit of truth." 81 This new dimension of prayer and
of its circumstances is displayed throughout the farewell dis­

course. 82

In

the Holy Spirit, Christian prayer is a communion of

love with the Father, not only through Christ but also

in him:

"Hitherto you have asked nothing in my name; ask, and you will
receive, that your joy may be full. " 83

Jesus hears our prayer
2616

Prayer to Jesus is answered by him already during his minis-

try, through signs that anticipate the power of his death and Resur­
rection: Jesus hears the prayer of faith, expressed in words (the leper,

Jairus, the Canaanite woman, the good thie£) 84 or in silence (the

548

bearers of the paralytic, the woman with a hemorrhage who touches
his clothes, the tears and ointment of the sinful woman). 85 The urgent
request of the blind men, "Have mercy on us, Son of David" or "Jesus,

Son of David, have mercy on me! " has been renewed in the traditional
prayer to Jesus known as the Jesus

Prayer: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of

God, have mercy on me, a sinner!" 86 Healing infirmities or forgiving

sins, Jesus always responds to a prayer offered in faith: "Your faith
has made you well; go in peace."

St. Augustine wonderfully summarizes the three dimensions
of Jesus' prayer: "He prays for us as our priest, prays in us as
our Head, and is prayed to by us as our God. Therefore let us
acknowledge our voice in him and his in us."87

The prayer of the Virgin Mary

148 2617

Mary's prayer is revealed to us at the dawning of the

fullness of time. Before the incarnation of the Son of God, and

before the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, her prayer cooperates in

a rmique way with the Father's plan of loving kindness: at the

494

Annunciation, for Christ's conception; at Pentecost, for the forma­

tion of the Church, his Body. 88 In the faith of his humble handmaid,
the Gift of God found the acceptance he had awaited from the

490

beginning of time. She whom the Ahnighty made "full of grace"

responds by offering her whole being: "Behold I am the handmaid of
the Lord; let it be [done] to me according to your word."

"Fiat " :

this

is Christian prayer: to be wholly God's, because he is wholly ours.

2674 2618

The Gospel reveals to us how Mary prays and intercedes

in faith. At Cana, 89 the mother of Jesus asks her son for the needs

of a wedding feast; this is the sign of another feast - that of the
wedding of the Lamb where he gives his body and blood at the
request of the Church, his Bride. It is at the hour of the New
Covenant, at the foot of the cross,9 0 that Mary is heard as the

726

Woman, the new Eve, the true "Mother of all the living."

2619

That is why the Canticle of Mary,9 1 the

Magnificat

(Latin)

or Megalynei (Byzantine) is the song both of the Mother of God and
of the Church; the song of the Daughter of Zion and of the new
People of God; the song of thanksgiving for the fullness of graces

724

poured out in the economy of salvation and the song of the "poor"
whose hope is met by the fulfilhnent of the promises made to our
ancestors, "to Abraham and to his posterity for ever."

IN BRIEF
2620

Jesus' filial prayer is the perfect model of prayer in the
New Testament. Often done in solitude and in secret,
the prayer of Jesus involves a loving adherence to the

will of the Father even to the Cross and an absolute
confidence in being heard.

2621

In his teaching, Jesus teaches his disciples to pray with

a purified heart, with lively and persevering faith,

with filial boldness. He calls them to vigilance and
invites them to present their petitions to God in his
name. Jesus Christ himself answers prayers addressed
to him.

2622

The prayers of the Virgin Mary, in her Fiat and Mag­
nificat, are characterized by the generous offering of
her whole being in faith.

ARTICLE 3

IN THE AGE OF THE CHURCH
On the day of Pentecost, the Spirit of the Promise was 731
poured out on the disciples, gathered "together in one place." 92
While awaiting the Spirit, "all these with one accord devoted
themselves to prayer." 93 The Spirit who teaches the Church and
recalls for her everything that Jesus said94 was also to form her in
the life of prayer.

2623

2624
In the first community of Jerusalem, believers "devoted 1 342
themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and the prayers." 95 This sequence is characteristic of
the Church's prayer: founded on the apostolic faith; authenticated
by charity; nourished in the Eucharist.
2625
In the first place these are prayers that the faithful hear and
read in the Scriptures, but also that they make their own - espe­
cially those of the Psalms, in view of their fulfillment in Christ.96
The Holy Spirit, who thus keeps the memory of Christ alive in his 1 092
Church at prayer, also leads her toward the fullness of truth and
inspires new formulations expressing the unfathomable mystery
of Christ at work in his Church's life, sacraments, and mission.
These formulations are developed in the great liturgical and spiritual traditions. The forms of prayer revealed in the apostolic and 1 200
canonical Scriptures remain normative for Christian prayer.

Part Four
B LESSING AND ADORATION

Blessing expresses the basic movement of Christian prayer:

it is an encounter between God and man.

In

blessing, God's gift

and man's acceptance of it are united in dialogue with each other.

The prayer of blessing is man's response to God's gifts: because
God blesses, the human heart can in return bless the One who is
the source of every blessing.

1083 2627

Two fundamental forms express this movement: our

prayer ascends in the Holy Spirit through Christ to the Father - we
bless him for having blessed us;97 it implores the grace of the Holy
Spirit that descends through Christ from the Father - he blesses us. 98

2096-2097 2628

Adoration

is the first attitude of man acknowledging that

he is a creature before his Creator. It exalts the greatness of the Lord
who made us 99 and the almighty power of the Savior who sets us
free from evil. Adoration is homage of the spirit to the "King of
Glory," 100 respectful silence in the presence of the "ever greater"
God. 101 Adoration of the thrice-holy and sovereign God of love

2559

blends with humility and gives assurance to our supplications.

II.

PRAYER OF PETITION

2629

The vocabulary of supplication in the New Testament is

rich in shades of meaning: ask, beseech, plead, invoke, entreat, cry
out, even "struggle in prayer." 1 02 Its most usual form, because the
most spontaneous, is petition: by prayer of petition we express

awareness of our relationship with God. We are creatures who are

396

not our own beginning, not the masters of adversity, not our own
last end. We are sinners who as Christians know that we have

turned away from our Father. Our petition is already a turning
back to him.

2090

2630
The New Testament contains scarcely any prayers of lamenta­
tion, so frequent in the Old Testament. In the risen Christ the Church's
petition is buoyed by hope, even if we still wait in a state of expectation
and must be converted anew every day. Christian petition, what St. Paul
calls "groaning," arises from another depth, that of creation "in labor
pains" and that of ourselves "as we wait for the redemption of our bodies.
97 Cf. Eph 1 :3-14; 2 Cor 1 :3-7; 1 Pet 1:3-9.
98 Cf. 2 Cor 1 3: 14; Rom 1 5 : 5-6, 13; Eph 6:23-24.
99 Cf. Ps 95 : 1 -6.
100 Ps 24, 9-10.
101 Cf. St. Augustine, En. in Ps. 62, 16: PL 36, 757-758 .
102 Cf. Rom 1 5 :30; Co / 4 :12
.

Christian Prayer

633

For in this hope we were saved .'' 103 In the end, however, "with sighs too
deep for words" the Holy Spirit "helps us in our weakness; for we do not
know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us
with sighs too deep for words:• 104

2631
Thefirst movement ofthe prayer ofpetition is askingforgiveness,
like the tax collector in the parable: "God, be merciful to me a sinner! " 105

2838

It is a prerequisite for righteous and pure prayer. A trusting humility
brings us back into the light of communion between the Father and his
Son Jesus Christ and with one another, so that "we receive from him
whatever we ask." 106 Asking forgiveness is the prerequisite for both the
Eucharistic liturgy and personal prayer.

2632

Christian petition is centered on the desire and

search for 281 6

the Kingdom to come, in keeping with the teaching of Christ. 107 There
is a hierarchy in these petitions: we pray first for the Kingdom, then
for what is necessary to welcome it and cooperate with its coming.

This collaboration with the mission of Christ and the Holy Spirit,

1 942

which is now that of the Church, is the object of the prayer of the
apostolic community. 108 It is the prayer of Paul, the apostle par
excellence, which reveals to us how the divine solicitude for all the

churches ought to inspire Christian prayer.1 09 By prayer every

2854

baptized person works for the coming of the Kingdom.

2633

When we share in God's saving love, we understand that

2830

every need can become the obj ect of petition. Christ, who assumed
all things in order to redeem all things, is glorified by what we ask

the Father in his name.l 10 It is with this confidence that St. James
and St. Paul exhort us to pray at all

times. 111

Ill.

PRAYER OF INTERCESSION

2634

Intercession is a prayer of petition which leads us to pray

as Jesus did. He is the one intercessor with the Father on behalf of
all men, especially sinners. 112 He is "able for all time to save those
who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make

intercession for th em . " 113 The Holy Spirit "himself intercedes for
us . . . and intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. " 114

2571 2635
Since Abraham, intercession - asking on behalf of another has been characteristic of a heart attuned to God's mercy. In the age
of the Church, Christian intercession participates in Christ's, as an
expression of the communion of saints. In intercession, he who prays
looks "not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others,"
2577 even to the point of praying for those who do him harm. 115
2636
The first Christian communities lived this form of fellow­
ship intensely. 116 Thus the Apostle Paul gives them a share in his
ministry of preaching the Gospel 117 but also intercedes for them.ll 8
The intercession of Christians recognizes no boundaries: "for all
1 900 men, for kings and all who are in high positions," for persecutors,
1 037 for the salvation of those who reject the Gospe1 . 119

IV.

PRAYER OF THANKSGIVING

224 2637
Thanksgiving characterizes the prayer of the Church
which, in celebrating the Eucharist, reveals and becomes more fully
1 328 what she is. Indeed, in the work of salvation, Christ sets creation
free from sin and death to consecrate it anew and make it return to
the Father, for his glory. The thanksgiving of the members of the
2603 Body participates in that of their Head.
2638
As in the prayer of petition, every event and need can
become an offering of thanksgiving. The letters of St. Paul often
begin and end with thanksgiving, and the Lord Jesus is always
present in it: "Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will
of God in Christ Jesus for you"; "Continue steadfastly in prayer,
being watchful in it with thanksgiving." 120

PRAYER OF PRAISE

2639

Praise is the form of prayer which recognizes most imme­

diately that God is God. It lauds God for his own sake and gives
him glory, quite beyond what he does, but simply because HE IS. It
shares in the blessed happiness of the pure of heart who love God

213

in faith before seeing him in glory. B y praise, the Spirit is joined to

our spirits to bear witness that we are children of God, 121 testifying

to the only Son in whom we are adopted and by whom we glorify

the Father. Praise embraces the other forms of prayer and carries

them toward him who is its source and goal: the "one God, the
Father, from whom are all things and for whom we ex ist 122
."

2640
St. Luke in his gospel often expresses wonder and praise at the
marvels of Christ and in his Acts of the Apostles stresses them as actions of
the Holy Spirit: the community of Jerusalem, the invalid healed by Peter
and John, the crowd that gives glory to God for that, and the pagans of
Pisidia who "were glad and glorified the word of God . '' 123
" [Address] one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
singing and making melody to the Lord with all your heart." 1 24 Like the
inspired writers of the New Testament, the first Christian communities
read the Book of Psalms in a new way, singing in it the mystery of Christ.
In the newness of the Spirit, they also composed hymns and canticles in
the light of the unheard-of event that God accomplished in his Son: his
Incarnation, his death which conquered death, his Resurrection, and As­
cension to the right hand of the Father. 125 Doxology, the praise of God
arises from this "marvelous work" of the whole economy of salvation. 126

2641

2642
The Revelation of "what must soon take place the Apocalypse, is
{
borne along by the songs of the heavenly liturgy 1 7 but also by the
2
intercession of the "witnesses" (martyrs).l 8 The prophets and the saints,
a l l those who were slain o n earth for their witness t o Jesus, the vast throng
of those who, having come through the great tribulation, have gone before
us into the Kingdom, all sing the praise and glory of him who sits on the
throne, and of the Lamb . 129 In communion with them, the Church on earth
also sings these songs with faith in the midst of trial. By means of petition
and intercession, faith hopes against all hope and gives thanks to the
"Father of lights," from whom "every perfect gift" comes downJ 30 Thus
faith is pure praise.

The Eucharist contains and expresses all forms of prayer:

it is "the pure offering" of the whole Body of Christ to the glory of
God's name 1 3 1 and, according to the traditions of East and West, it

1 330

is

the "sacrifice of praise."

IN BRIEF

2644

The Holy Spirit who teaches the Church and recalls to
her all that Jesus said also instructs her in the life of
prayer, inspiring new expressions of the same basic
forms o f p r ayer: blessing, petition, intercession,
thanksgiving, and praise.

2645

Because God blesses the human heart, it can in return

bless him who is the source of every blessing.

2646

Forgiveness, the quest for the Kingdom, and every

true need are objects of the prayer of petition.

2647

Prayer of intercession consists in asking on behalf of
another. It knows no boundaries and extends to one's

enemies.

2648

Every joy and suffering, every event and need can
become the matter for thanksgiving which, sharing in
that of Christ, should fill one's whole life: "Give thanks
in all circumstances"

2649

(1 Thess 5:18).

Prayer of praise is entirely disinterested and rises to God,
lauds him and gives him glory for his own sake, quite
,

beyond what he has done, but simply because HE IS.

C HAPTER Two
THE TRADITION OF P RAYER

Prayer cannot be reduced to the spontaneous outpouring
of interior impulse: in order to pray, one must have the will to pray.
Nor is it enough to know what the Scriptures reveal about prayer:
one must also learn how to pray. Through a living transmission
(Sacred Tradition) within "the believing and praying Church," 1 the 75
Holy Spirit teaches the children of God how to pray.

2650

The tradition of Christian prayer is one of the ways in which 94
the tradition of faith takes shape and grows, especially through the
contemplation and study of believers who treasure in their hearts the
events and words of the economy of salvation, and through their
profound grasp of the spiritual realities they experience. 2

ARTICLE 1

AT THE WELLSPRINGS OF PRAYER
The Holy Spirit is the living water "welling up to eternal life"3 694
in the heart that prays. It is he who teaches us to accept it at its source:
Christ. Indeed in the Christian life there are several wellsprings where
Christ awaits us to enable us to drink of the Holy Spirit.

2652

The Word of God
The Church "forcefully and specially exhorts all the Chris- 133
tian faithful . . . to learn 'the surpassing knowledge of Jesus Christ'
(Phil 3:8) by frequent reading of the divine Scriptures . . . . Let them
remember, however, that prayer should accompany the reading of
Sacred Scripture, so that a dialogue takes place between God and
man. For 'we speak to him when we pray; we listen to him when 1 1 00
we read the divine oracles.'" 4

2653

2654
The spiritual writers, paraphrasing Matthew 7:7, summa­
rize in this way the dispositions of the heart nourished by the word
of God in prayer: "Seek in reading and you will find in meditating;

The Liturgy of the Church

In

the sacramental liturgy of the Church, the mission of

Christ and of the Holy Spirit proclaims, makes present, and com­
municates the mystery of salvation, which is continued in the heart

368

One enters into prayer as one enters into liturgy: by the

of the Lord that we seek and desire; it is his Word that we want to
hear and keep .

2657
The Holy Spirit, who instructs us to celebrate the liturgy
in expectation of Christ's return, teaches us to pray in hope. Con­
versely, the prayer of the Church and personal prayer nourish hope
in us. The psalms especially, with their concrete and varied lan­
guage, teach us to fix our hope in God:

"I waited patiently for the

LORD; he inclined to me and heard my cry . " 8 As St. Paul prayed:

"May the God of hope fill you with all j oy and peace in believing,
so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope. " 9

2658

"Hope does not disappoint us, because God's love has been

poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit who has been given to
us." 1 0 Prayer, formed by the liturgical life, draws everything into
the love by which we are loved in Christ and which enables us to

influence the march of history, but it is just as important to bring the

ARTICLE 2
THE WAY OF PRAYER

1201 2663

In the living tradition of prayer, each Church proposes to

its faithful, according to its historic, social, and cultural context, a
language for prayer: words, melodies, gestures, iconography. The
Magisterium of the Church 15 has the task of discerning the fidelity
of these ways of praying to the tradition of apostolic faith; it is for
pastors and catechists to explain their meaning, always in relation

to Jesus Christ.

Prayer to the Father
2664

There is no other way of Christian prayer than Christ.

Whether our prayer is communal or personal, vocal or interior, it

2780

has access to the Father only if we pray "in the name" of Jesus. The
sacred humanity of Jesus is therefore the way by which the Holy

Spirit teaches us to pray to God our Father.

Prayer to Jesus
2665

The prayer of the Church, nourished by the Word of God

and the celebration of the liturgy, teaches us to pray to the Lord

451

Jesus. Even though her prayer is addressed above all to the Father,
it includes in all the liturgical traditions forms of prayer addressed
to Christ. Certain psalms, given their use in the Prayer of the
Church, and the New Testament place on our lips and engrave in
our hearts prayer to Christ in the form of invocations: Son of God,

Word of God, Lord, Savior, Lamb of God, King, Beloved Son, Son
of the

Virgin,

Good Shepherd, our Life, our Light, our Hope, our

Resurrection, Friend of mankind. . . .

2666

432

But the one name that contains everything is the one that

the Son of God received in his incarnation: JESUS. The divine name

may not be spoken by human lips, but by assuming our humanity
The Word of God hands it over to us and we can invoke it: "Jesus,"
"YHWH saves. " 16 The name "Jesus" contains all: God and man and

435

the whole economy of creation and salvation. To pray "Jesus" is to

invoke him and to call him within us. His name is the only one that

contains the presence it signifies. Jesus is the Risen One, and

Christian Prayer

641

whoever invokes the name of Jesus is welcoming the Son of God
who loved him and who gave himself up for himP

2667
This simple invocation of faith developed in the tradition of
prayer under many forms in East and West. The most usual formulation,
transmitted by the spiritual writers of the Sinai, Syria, and Mt. Athos, is
the invocation, "Lord Jesus Christ, Son o f God, have mercy o n u s sinners."
It combines the Christological hymn of Philippians 2:6-11 with the cry of
the publican and the blind men begging for light. 18 By it the heart is opened
to human wretchedness and the Savior's mercy.

2616

2668
The invocation of the holy name of Jesus is the simplest way of
praying always. When the holy name is repeated often by a humbly
9
attentive heart, the prayer is not lost by heaping up empty phrases, 1 but
i2°
holds fast to the word and ''brings forth fruit with patience.'
This prayer
is possible " at all times" because it is not one occupation among others but
the only occupation: that of loving God, which animates and transfigures
every action in Christ Jesus.

435

2669
The prayer of the Church venerates and honors the Heart ofJesus
just as it invokes his most holy name. It adores the incarnate Word and his
Heart which, out of love for men, he allowed to be pierced by our sins.
Christian prayer loves to follow the way of the cross in the Savior's steps.
The stations from the Praetorium to Golgotha and the tomb trace the way
of Jesus, who by his holy Cross has redeemed the world .

478

1 674

"Come, Holy Spirit"
"No one can say 'Jesus is Lord' except by the Holy Spirit . 21
Every time we begin to pray to Jesus it is the Holy Spirit who draws
us on the way of prayer by his prevenient grace. Since he teaches us
to pray by recalling Christ, how could we not pray to the Spirit too?
That is why the Church invites us to call upon the Holy Spirit every
day, especially at the beginning and the end of every important action.

2670

"

I f the Spirit should not b e worshiped, how can h e divinize
me through Baptism? If he should be worshiped, should he
not be the object of adoration? 22

The traditional form of petition to the Holy Spirit is to invoke
the Father through Christ our Lord to give us the Consoler Spirit.23
Jesus insists on this petition to be made in his name at the very moment

when he promises the gift of the Spirit of Truth. 24 But the simplest
and most direct prayer is also traditional, "Come, Holy Spirit," and

every liturgical tradition has developed it in antiphons and hymns.
Come, Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful and enkin­
dle in them the fire of your love. 25
Heavenly King, Consoler Spirit, Spirit of Truth, present
everywhere and filling all things, treasure of all good and
source of all life, come dwell in us, cleanse and save us, you
who are All-Good. 26

695 2672

The Holy Spirit, whose anointing permeates our whole

being, is the interior Master of Christian prayer. He is the artisan

of the living tradition of prayer. To be sure, there are as many paths
of prayer as there are persons who pray, but it is the same Spirit
acting in all and with all. It is in the cpmmunion of the Holy Spirit
that Christian prayer is prayer in the Church.

In communion with the holy Mother of God

689 2673

In prayer the Holy Spirit unites us to the person of the only

Son, in his glorified humanity, through which and in which our
filial prayer unites us in the Church with the Mother of Jesus. 27

494 2674

Mary gave her consent in faith at the Annunciation and

maintained it without hesitation at the foot of the Cross. Ever since,
her motherhood has extended to the brothers and sisters of her Son

"who still journey on earth surrounded by dangers and difficul­

ties." 28 Jesus, the only mediator, is the way of our prayer; Mary, his

mother and ours, is wholly transparent to him: she "shows the
way"

(hodigitria), and is herself "the Sign" of the way, according to

the traditional iconography of East and West.

970 2675

Beginning with Mary's unique cooperation with the work-

ing of the Holy Spirit, the Churches developed their prayer to the
holy Mother of God, centering it on the person of Christ manifested

512 in his mysteries. In countless hynms and antiphons expressing this

prayer, two movements usually alternate with one another: the

servant and through her for all human beings;29 the second en­

trusts the supplications and praises of the children of God to the

Mother of Jesus, because she now knows the humanity which, in
her, the Son of God espoused.

2676
This twofold movement of prayer to Mary has found
expression in the Ave Maria:

a

privileged

Hail Mary [or Rejoice, Mary]: the greeting of the angel Gabriel
opens this prayer. It is God himself who, through his angel as intermediary, greets Mary. Our prayer dares to take up this greeting to Mary with
the regard God had for the lowliness of his humble servant and to exult in
the joy he finds in her. 30

722

Full ofgrace, the Lord is with thee: These two phrases of the angel's
greeting shed light on one another. Mary is full of grace because the Lord
is with her. The grace with which she is filled is the presence of him who

490

is the source of all grace. "Rejoice . . 0 Daughter of Jerusalem . . . the Lord
your God is in your midst."31 Mary, in whom the Lord himself has just
made his dwelling, is the daughter of Zion in person, the ark of the
covenant, the place where the glory of the Lord dwells. She is "the dwelling
of God . . . with men." 32 Full of grace, Mary is wholly given over to him
who has come to dwell in her and whom she is about to give to the world.
.

Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, 435
Jesus. After the angel's greeting, we make Elizabeth's greeting our own.

"Filled with the Holy Spirit," Elizabeth is the first in the long succession
of generations who have called Mary "blessed."33 "Blessed is she who
believed . . . . "34 Mary is "blessed among women" because she believed in
the fulfillment of the Lord's word. Abraham,� because of his faith, became
a blessing for all the nations of the earth. 30 Mary, because of her faith,
became the mother of believers, through whom all nations of the earth
receive him who is God's own blessing: Jesus, the "fruit of thy womb."

2677
Holy Mary, Mother of God: With Elizabeth we marvel, "And why
is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?" 3'6
Because she gives us Jesus, her son, Mary is Mother of God and our mother;
we can entrust all our cares and petitions to her: she prays for us as she
prayed for herself: "Let it be to me according to your word."37 By entrusting ourselves to her prayer, we abandon ourselves to the will of God
together with her: "Thy will be done."

Prayfor us sinners, now and at the lwur ofour death: B y asking Mary to

to her now, in the Today of our lives. And our trust broadens further, already
at the present moment, to surrender "the hour of our death" wholly to her
care. May she be there as she was at her son's death on the cross. May she
welcome us as our mother at the hour of our passin

Medieval piety in the West developed the prayer of the rosary as
a popular substitute for the Liturgy of the Hours. In the East, the litany
called the Akathistos and the Paraclesis remained closer to the choral office
in the Byzantine churches, while the Armenian, Coptic, and Syriac tradi­
tions preferred popular hymns and songs to the Mother of God . But in the
Ave Maria, the theotokia, the hymns of St. Ephrem or St. Gregory of Narek,
the tradition of prayer is basically the same.

971, 1 674 2678

Mary is the perfect Orans (pray-er), a figure of the Church.
When we pray to her, we are adhering with her to the plan of the
Father, who sends his Son to save all men. Like the beloved disciple
we welcome Jesus' mother into our homes,39 for she has become the
mother of all the living. We can pray with and to her. The prayer of the
972 Church is sustained by the prayer of Mary and united with it in hope.40

967 2679

IN BRIEF
2680

Prayer is primarily addressed to the Father; it can also
be directed toward Jesus, particularly by the invoca­
tion of his holy name: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God,
have mercy on us sinne rs."

2681

"No one can say 'Jesus is Lord', except by the Holy
Spirit" (1 Cor 1 2:3). The Church invites us to invoke the
Holy Spirit as the interior Teacher of Christian prayer.

2682

Because of Mary's singular cooperation with the ac­
tion of the Holy Spirit, the Church loves to pray in
conununion with the Virgin Mary, to magnify with
her the great things the Lord has done for her, and to
entrust supplications and praises to her.

ARTICLE 3
GUIDES FOR PRAYER

A cloud of witnesses
The witnesses who have preceded us into the kingdom,4 1
especially those whom the Church recognizes as saints, share in
the living tradition of prayer by the example of their lives, the
transmission of their writings, and their prayer today. They con­
template God, praise him and constantly care for those whom they
have left on earth. When they entered into the joy of their Master, 956
they were "put in charge of many things." 42 Their intercession is
their most exalted service to God's plan. We can and should ask
them to intercede for us and for the whole world.

2683

2684
In the communion of saints, many and varied spiritualities 9 1 7
have been developed throughout the history o f the churches. The
personal charism of some witnesses to God's love for men has been
handed on, like "the spirit" of Elijah to Elisha and John the Baptist, 919
so that their followers may have a share in this spirit. 43 A distinct
spirituality can also arise at the point of convergence of liturgical
and theological currents, bearing witness to the integration of the
faith into a particular human environment and its history. The 1 202
different schools of Christian spirituality share in the living tradition of prayer and are essential guides for the faithful. In their rich
diversity they are refractions of the one pure light of the Holy Spirit.
The Spirit is truly the dwelling of the saints and the saints
are for the Spirit a place where he dwells as in his own home,
since they offer themselves as a dwelling p lace for God and
44
are called his temple.

Servants of prayer
2685
The Christian family is the first place of education in prayer. 1 657
Based on the sacrament of marriage, the family is the "domestic
church" where God's children learn to pray "as the Church" and
to persevere in prayer. For young children in particular, daily
family prayer is the first witness of the Church's living memory as
awakened patiently by the Holy Spirit.

Part Four
Ordained min isters are also responsible for the formation in

prayer of their brothers and sisters in Christ. Servants of the Good

Shepherd, they are ordained to lead the People of God to the living
waters of prayer: the Word of God, the liturgy, the theologal life
(the life of faith, hope, and charity), and the Today of God in

concrete situations. 45

91 6 2687

Many

religious

have consecrated their whole lives to

prayer. Hermits, monks, and nuns since the time of the desert
fathers have devoted their time to praising God and interceding
for his people. The consecrated life cannot be sustained or spread

without prayer; it is one of the living sources of contemplation and

the spiritual life of the Church.

2688

The

catechesis of children, young people, and

adults aims

at teaching them to meditate on The Word of God in personal

prayer, practicing it in liturgical prayer, and internalizing it at all
times in order to bear fruit in a new life. Catechesis is also a time

1 674

for the discernment and education of popular piety. 46 The memo­

rization of basic prayers offers an essential support to the life of
prayer, but it is important to help learners savor their meaning.

2689

Prayer groups, indeed

"schools of prayer," are today one of

the signs and one of the driving forces of renewal of prayer in the
Church, provided they drink from authentic wellsprings of Chris­
tian prayer. Concern for ecclesial communion is a sign of true
prayer in the Church.

2690

The Holy Spirit gives to certain of the faithful the gifts of

this common good
(spiritual direction). Men and women so endowed

wisdom, faith and discernment for the sake of

which is prayer

are true servants of the living tradition of prayer.

According to St. John of the Cross, the person wishing to
advance toward perfection should "take care into whose
hands he entrusts himself, for as the master is, so will the
disciple be, and as the father is so will be the son." And
further: "In addition to being learned and discreet a director
should be experienced . . . . If the spiritual director has no
experience of the spiri tual life, he will be incapable of leading
into it the souls whom God is calling to it, and he will not
even understand them." 47

Places favorable for prayer

Sacrament. The choice of a favorable place is not a matter of
indifference for true prayer.

- For personal prayer, this can be a "prayer co mer" with the Sacred
Scriptures and icons, in order to be there, in secret, before our

Father. 48

In

a Christian family, this kind of little oratory fosters

prayer in common.

- In regions where monasteries exist, the vocation of these commu- 1 1 75
nities is to further the participation of the faithful in the Liturgy of
the Hours and to provide necessary solitude for more intense
personal prayer. 49
- Pilgrimages evoke our earthly journey toward heaven and are
traditionally very special occasions for renewal in prayer. For
pilgrims seeking living water, shrines are special places for living
the forms of Christian prayer "in Church. "

CHAPTER THREE
THE LIFE OF PRAYER

Prayer is the life of the new heart. It ought to animate us at
every moment. But we tend to forget him who is our life and our all.
This is why the Fathers of the spiritual life in the Deuteronomic and
prophetic traditions insist that prayer is a remembrance of God often
1099 awakened by the memory of the heart: "We must remember God
more often than we draw breath." 1 But we cannot pray "at all times"
if we do not pray at specific times, consciously willing it. These are the
special times of Christian prayer, both in intensity and duration.

2697

The Tradition of the Church proposes to the faithful certain rhythms of praying intended to nourish continual prayer.
Some are daily, such as morning and evening prayer, grace before
1 1 74 and after meals, the Liturgy of the Hours. Sundays, centered on the
2 1 77 Eucharist, are kept holy primarily by prayer. The cycle of the
liturgical year and its great feasts are also basic rhythms of the
Christian's life of prayer.

1 1 68 2698

The Lord leads all persons by paths and in ways pleasing
to him, and each believer responds according to his heart's resolve
and the personal expressions of his prayer. However, Christian
Tradition has retained three major expressions of prayer: vocal,
meditative, and contemplative. They have one basic trait in com2563 man: composure of heart. This vigilance in keeping the Word and
dwelling in the presence of God makes these three expressions
intense times in the life of prayer.

2699

ARTICLE 1

EXPRES SIONS OF PRAYER

I.

VOCAL PRAYER

Through his Word, God speaks to man. By words, mental
or vocal, our prayer takes flesh. Yet it is most important that the
heart should be present to him to whom we are speaking in prayer:
"Whether or not our prayer is heard depends not on the number
of words, but on the fervor of our souls." 2

1 1 76 2700

1 St. Gregory of Nazianzus, Orat. theo., 27, 1, 4: PG 36, 16.
2 St. John Chrysostom, Ecloga de oratione 2: PG 63, 585.

Christian Prayer

649

2701
Vocal prayer is an essential element of the Christian life.
To his disciples, drawn by their Master's silent prayer, Jesus
teaches a vocal prayer, the Our Father. He not only prayed aloud
the liturgical prayers of the synagogue but, as the Gospels show, 2603
he raised his voice to express his personal prayer, from exultant
blessing of the Father to the agony of Gesthemani.3
612
2702
The need to involve the senses in interior prayer corre­
sponds to a requirement of our human nature. We are body and
spirit, and we experience the need to translate our feelings exter- 1 146
nally. We must pray with our whole being to give all power
possible to our supplication.
2703
This need also corresponds to a divine requirement. God
seeks worshippers in Spirit and in Truth, and consequently living
prayer that rises from the depths of the soul. He also wants the
external expression that associates the body with interior prayer,
for it renders him that perfect homage which is his due.
2097
2704
Because it is external and so thoroughly human, vocal prayer
is the form of prayer most readily accessible to groups. Even interior
prayer, however, cannot neglect vocal prayer. Prayer is internalized
to the extent that we become aware of him "to whom we speak."4
Thus vocal prayer becomes an initial form of contemplative prayer.

II.

MEDITATION

2705
Meditation is above all a quest. The mind seeks to understand 158
the why and how of the Christian life, in order to adhere and respond
to what the Lord is asking. The required attentiveness is difficult to
sustain. We are usually helped by books, and Christians do not want
for them: the Sacred Scriptures, particularly the Gospels, holy icons,
liturgical texts of the day or season, writings of the spiritual fathers, 127
works of spirituality, the great book of creation, and that of history the page on which the "today" of God is written.
2706
To meditate on what we read helps us to make it our own
by confronting it with ourselves. Here, another book is opened: the
book of life. We pass from thoughts to reality. To the extent that
we are humble and faithful, we discover in meditation the move-

ments that stir the heart and we are able to discern them. It is a
question of acting truthfully in order to come into the light: "Lord,
what do you want me to do?"

2690 2707

There are as many and varied methods of meditation as

there are spiritual masters. Christians owe it to themselves to
develop the desire to meditate regularly, lest they come to resemble

the three first kinds of soil in the parable of the sower.s But a

2664

method is only a guide; the important thing is to advance, with the
Holy Spirit, along the one way of prayer: Christ Jesus.

2708

Meditation engages thought, imagination, emotion, and

desire. This mobilization of faculties is necessary in order to deepen

our convictions of faith, prompt the conversion of our heart, and

strengthen our will to follow Christ. Christian prayer tries above
all to meditate on the mysteries of Christ, as in

51 6
2678

lectio divina

or the

rosary. This form of prayerful reflection is of great value, but
Christian prayer should go further: to the knowledge of the love of
the Lord Jesus, to union with him.

CONTEMPLATIVE PRAYER

2709

What is contemplative prayer? St. Teresa answers: "Con­

templative prayer

2562-2564

[oraci6n mental]

in my opinion is nothing else

than a close sharing between friends; it means taking time fre­
quently to be alone with him who we know loves us."6

Contemplative prayer seeks him "whom my soul loves." 7 It is

Jesus, and in him, the Father. We seek him, because to desire him

is

always the beginning of love, and we seek him in that pure faith which
causes us to be born of him and to live in him.

In this inner prayer we

can still meditate, but our attention is fixed on the Lord himself.

2710

The choice of the

time and duration of the prayer arises from

a determined will, revealing the secrets of the heart. One does not

2726

undertake contemplative prayer only when one has the time: one
makes time for the Lord, with the firm determination not to give

up, no matter what trials and dryness one may encounter. One
cannot always meditate, but one can always enter into inner

prayer, independently of the conditions of health, work, or emo-

tiona! state. The heart is the place of this quest and encounter, in
poverty and in faith.
2711
En tering into contemplative prayer is like entering into the
Eucharistic liturgy: we "gather up" the heart, recollect our whole
being under the promp ting of the Holy Spirit, abide in the dwelling 1348
place of the Lord which we are, awaken our faith in order to enter
into the presence of him who awaits us. We let our masks fall and
turn our hearts back to the Lord who loves us, so as to hand
ourselves over to him as an offering to be purified and transformed . 2100
2712
Contemplative prayer is the prayer of the child of God, of
the forgiven sinner who agrees to welcome the love by which he is
loved and who wants to respond to it by loving even more. 8 But he
knows that the love he is returning is poured out by the Spirit in
his heart, for everything is grace from God. Contemplative prayer
is the poor and humble surrender to the loving will of the Father
2822
in ever deeper union with his beloved Son.
2713
Contemplative prayer is the simplest expression of the 2559
mystery of prayer. It is a gift, a grace; it can be accepted only in
humility and poverty. Contemplative prayer is a covenan t relationship established by God within our hearts. 9 Contemplative prayer
is a communion in which the Holy Trinity conforms man, the image
of God, "to his likeness."
2714
Contemplative prayer is also the pre-eminently intense time
of prayer. In it the Father strengthens our inner being with power
through his Spirit "that Christ may dwell in [our] hearts through
faith" and we may be "grounded in love. " l O
2715
Contemplation is a gaze of faith, fixed on Jesus. "I look at
him and he looks at me": this is what a certain peasant of Ars in the
time of his holy cure used to say while praying before the taberna­
cle. This focus on Jesus is a renunciation of self. His gaze purifies
our heart; the light of the <:ountenance of Jesus illumines the eyes
of our heart and teaches us to see everything in the light of his truth
and his compassion for all men. Contemplation also turns its gaze 52 1
on the mysteries of the life of Christ. Thus it learns the "interior
knowledge of our Lord, " the more to love him and follow him. 11

Contemplative prayer i s hearing the Word o f G o d . Far from

being passive, such attentiveness is the obedience of faith, the

494

unconditional acceptance of a servant, and the loving commitment

of a child. It participates in the "Yes" of the Son become servant
and the

Fiat of God's lowly handmaid.

Contemplative prayer is silence, the "symbol of the world
to come" 12 or "silent love. " 13 Words in this kind of prayer are not

533 2717

speeches; they are like kindling that feeds the fire of love.

In

this

silence, unbearable to the "outer" man, the Father speaks to us his
incarnate Word, who suffered, died, and rose; in this silence the

498

Spirit of adoption enables us to share in the prayer of Jesus.

2718

Contemplative prayer is a union with the prayer of Christ

insofar as it makes us participate in his mystery. The mystery of

Christ is celebrated by the Church in the Eucharist, and the Holy

Spirit makes it come alive in contemplative prayer so that our
charity will manifest it in our acts.

2719

Contemplative prayer is a communion of love bearing Life

for the multitude, to the extent that it consents to abide in the night

1 65

of faith. The Paschal night of the Resurrection passes through the
night of the agony and the tomb - the three intense moments of the
Hour of Jesus which his Spirit (and not "the flesh [which] is weak")

2730

brings to life in prayer. We must be willing to "keep watch with
[him] one hour." 14

IN BRIEF
2720

The Church invites the faithful to regular prayer: daily
prayers, the Liturgy of the Hours, Sunday Eucharist ,
the feasts of the liturgical year.

2721

The Christian tradition comprises three major expres­
sions of the life of prayer: vocal prayer, meditation,
and contemplative prayer. They have in common the
recollection of the heart.

2722

Vocal prayer, founded on the union of body and soul

in human nature, associates the body with the interior

prayer of the heart, following Christ's example of

praying to his Father and teaching the Our Father to
his disciples.
2723

Meditation is a prayerful quest engaging thought,
imagination, emotion, and desire. Its goal is to make
our own in faith the subject considered, by confronting
it with the reality of our own life.

2724

Contemplative prayer is the simple expression of the
mystery of prayer. It is a gaze of faith fixed on Jesus,
an attentiveness to the Word of God, a silent love. It
achieves real union with the prayer of Christ to the
extent that it makes us share in his mystery.

ARTICLE 2

THE BATTLE OF PRAYER

2725
Prayer is both a gift of grace and a determined response on
our part. It always presupposes effort. The great figures of prayer of
the Old Covenant before Christ, as well as the Mother of God, the
saints, and he himself, all teach us this: prayer is a battle. Against
whom? Against ourselves and against the wiles of the tempter who 2612
does all he can to turn man away from prayer, away from union with 409
God. We pray as we live, because we live as we pray. If we do not
want to act habitually according to the Spirit of Christ, neither can we
pray habitually in his name. The "spiritual battle" of the Christian's
2015
new life is inseparable from the battle of prayer.

I.

OBJECTIONS TO PRAYER

In the battle of prayer, we must face in ourselves and
around us erroneous notions of prayer. Some people view prayer as
a simple psychological activity, others as an effort of concentration
to reach a mental void. Still others reduce prayer to ritual words
and postures. Many Christians unconsciously regard prayer as an
occupation that is incompatible with all the other things they have
to do: they "don't have the time." Those who seek God by prayer 2 71 0
are quickly discouraged because they d o not know that prayer
comes also from the Holy Spirit and not from themselves alone.

2726

Part Four

654
2727

W e must also face the fact that certain attitudes deriving

from the

mentality of "this

present world" can penetrate our lives

if we are not vigilant. For example, some would have it that only

37 that is true which can be verified by reason and science; yet prayer
is a mystery that overflows both our conscious and unconscious

lives . Others overly prize production and profit; thus prayer, being
unproductive, is useless. Still others exalt sensuality and comfort
as the criteria of the true, the good, and the beautiful; whereas
prayer, the "love of beauty" (philokalia), is caught up in the glory

2500

of the living and true God. Finally, some see prayer as a flight from

the world in reaction against activism; but in fact, Christian prayer

is neither an escape from reality nor a divorce from life.

2728
Finally, our battle has to confront what we experience as
failure in prayer: discouragement during periods of dryness; sad­
ness that, because we have "great possessions," 1 5 we have not

given all to the Lord; disappointment over not being heard accord­
ing to our own will; wounded pride, stiffened by the indignity that
is ours as sinn ers; our resistance to the idea that prayer is a free and
unmerited gift; and so forth. The conclusion is always the same:
what good does it do to pray? To overcome these obstacles, we
must battle to gain humility, trust, and perseverance.

II.

HUMBLE VIGILANCE OF HEART

Facing difficulties in prayer
2729

The habitual difficulty in prayer is distraction. It can affect

words and their meaning in vocal prayer; it can concern, more
profoundly, him to whom we are praying, in vocal prayer (liturgi­

cal or personal), meditation, and contemplative prayer. To set
about hunting down distractions would be to fall into their trap,

when all that is necessary is to turn back to our heart: for a

271 1

distraction reveals to us what we are attached to, and this humble
awareness before the Lord should awaken our preferential love for

him and lead us resolutely to offer him our heart to be purified.
Therein lies the battle, the choice of which master to serve. 1 6

2730

In

positive terms, the battle against the possessive and

dominating self requires

vigilance,

sobriety of heart. When Jesus

insists on vigilance, he always relates it to himself, to his coming

2659

on the last day and every day:

1 5 Cf. Mk 10:22.

16 Cf. Mt 6:21, 24.

today. The bridegroom comes in the

Christian Prayer

655

middle of the night; the light that must not be extinguished is that
of faith: '"Come,' my heart says, 'seek his face! ' " 17
Another difficulty, especially for those who sincerely want
to pray, is dryness. Dryness belongs to contemplative prayer when
the heart is separated from God, with no taste for thoughts, memo­
ries, and feelings, even spiritual ones. This is the moment of sheer
faith clinging faithfully to Jesus in his agony and in his tomb.
"Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains
alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. " 1 8 If dryness is due to the
lack of roots, because the word has fallen on rocky soil, the battle 1426
requires conversion. 1 9

2731

Facing temptations in prayer
2732
The most common yet most hidden temptation is our lack of 2609
faith. It expresses itself less by declared incredulity than by our actual
preferences. When we begin to pray, a thousand labors or cares 2089
thought to be urgent vie for priority; once again, it is the moment of
truth for the heart: what is its real love? Sometimes we tum to the Lord
as a last resort, but do we really believe he is? Sometimes we enlist the
Lord as an ally, but our heart remains presumptuous. In each case,
our lack of faith reveals that we do not yet share in the disposition of
2092, 2074
a humble heart: "Apart from me, you can do nothing. "20

2733
Another temptation, to which presumption opens the 2094
gate, is acedia. The spiritual writers understand by this a form of
depression due to lax ascetical practice, decreasing vigilance, carelessness of heart. "The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
weak." 21 The greater the height, the harder the fall. Painful as
discouragement is, it is the reverse of presumption. The humble
are not surprised by their distress; it leads them to trust more, to 2559
hold fast in constancy.
Ill.

FILIAL TRUST

Filial trust is tested - it proves itself - in tribulation. 22 The
principal difficulty concerns the prayer of petition, for oneself or for 2629
others in intercession. Some even stop praying because they think

their petition is not heard . Here two questions should be asked:

Why do we think our petition has not been heard ? How is our
prayer heard, how is it "efficacious" ?

Why do we complain of not being heard?
In the first place, we ought to be astonished by this fact: when

2735

we praise God or give him thanks for his benefits in general, we are

not particularly concerned whether or not our prayer is acceptable to

him On the other hand, we demand to see the results of our petitions.
.

What is the image of God that motivates our prayer: an instrument to

2779

be used? or the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ?
Are we convinced that "we do not know how to pray as

2559 2736

we ought" ?23 Are we asking God for "what is good for us"? Our
Father knows what we need before we ask him, 24 but he awaits our

1 730

petition because the dignity of his children lies in their freedom.

We must pray, then, with his Spirit of freedom, to be able truly to
know what he wants. 25
"You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to

2737

spend it on your passions. " 26 If we ask with a divided heart, we are
"adulterers";27 God cann ot answer us, for he desires our well-be­

ing, our life. "Or do you suppose that it is in vain that the scripture
says, 'He yearns jealously over the spirit which he has made to
dwell in us?"' 28 That our God is "jealous" for us is the sign of how
true his love is. If we enter into the desire of his Spirit, we shall be
heard.
Do not be troubled if you do not immediately receive from
God what you ask him; for he desires to do something even
greater for you, while you cling to him in prayer. 29
God wills that our desire should be exercised in prayer that
3
we may be able to receive what he is prepared to give. 0

Christian Prayer

657

How is our prayer efficacious?
2738
The revelation of prayer in the economy of salvation
teaches us that faith rests on God's action in history. Our filial trust
is enkindled by his supreme act: the Passion and Resurrection of 2568
his Son. Christian prayer is cooperation with his providence, his 307
plan of love for men.
2739
For St. Paul, this trust is bold, founded on the prayer of the 2778
Spirit in us and on the faithful love of the Father who has given us
his only Son. 31 Transformation of the praying heart is the first
response to our petition.
2740
The prayer of Jesus makes Christian prayer an efficacious
petition. He is its model, he prays in us and with us. Since the heart of
the Son seeks only what pleases the Father, how could the prayer of the
children of adoption be centered on the gifts rather than the Giver?
2604
2741
Jesus also prays for us - in our place and on our behalf. All
our petitions were gathered up, once for all, in his cry on the Cross
and, in his Resurrection, heard by the Father. This is why he never 2606
ceases to intercede for us with the Father. 32 If our prayer is reso­
lutely united with that of Jesus, in trust and boldness as children,
we obtain all that we ask in his name, even more than any particular 2614
thing: the Holy Spirit himself, who contains all gifts.
IV.

PERSERVERING IN LOVE

2742
"Pray constantly . . . always and for everything giving 2098
thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father." 33
St. Paul adds, "Pray at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and
supplication. To that end keep alert with all perseverance making
supplication for all the saints." 34 For "we have not been com­
manded to work, to keep watch and to fast constantly, but it has
been laid down that we are to pray without ceasing."35 This tireless
fervor can come only from love. Against our dullness and laziness,
the battle of prayer is that of humble, trusting, and persevering love.
This love opens our hearts to three enlightening and life-giving 1 62
facts of faith about prayer.

31 Cf. Rom 10:12-13; 8:26-39.
32 Cf. Heb 5:7; 7:25; 9:24.

658

2743
It is always possible to pray: The time of the Christian is that
of the risen Christ who is with us always, no matter what tempests
may arise. 36 Our time is in the hands of God:
I t is possible to offer fervent prayer even while walking in
public or strolling alone, or seated in your shop, . . . while
7
buying or selling, . . . or even while cooking. 3

2744
Prayer is a vital necessity . Proof from the contrary is no less
convincing: if we do not allow the Spirit to lead us, we fall back
into the slavery of sin. 38 How can the Holy Spirit be our life if our
heart is far from him?
Nothing is equal to prayer; for what is impossible it makes
possible, what is difficult, easy . . . . For it is impossible, utterly
impossible, for the man who prays eagerly and invokes God
ceaselessly ever to sin. 39
Those who pray are certainly saved; those who do not pray
are certainly damned.40

2745
Prayer and Christian life are inseparable, for they concern the
same love and the same renunciation, proceeding from love; the same
filial and loving conformity with the Father's plan of love; the same
transforming union in the Holy Spirit who conforms us more and
more to Christ Jesus; the same love for all men, the love with which
2660 Jesus has loved us. "Whatever you ask the Father inmyname,he [will]
give it to you. This I command you, to love one another."41
He "prays without ceasing" who unites prayer to works and
good works to prayer. Only in this way can we consider as
realizable the principle of praying without ceasing.42

ARTICLE 3
THE PRAYER OF THE HOUR OF JESUS

2746
When "his hour" came, Jesus prayed to the Father.43 His
prayer, the longest transmitted by the Gospel, embraces the whole
economy of creation and salvation, as well as his death and Resur­
rection. The prayer of the Hour of Jesus always remains his own, 1 085
just as his Passover "once for all" remains ever present in the
liturgy of his Church.
2747
Christian Tradition rightly calls this prayer the "priestly"
prayer of Jesus. It is the prayer of our high priest, inseparable from
his sacrifice, from his passing over (Passover) to the Father to
whom he is wholly "consecrated." 44
2748
In this Paschal and sacrificial prayer, everything is reca- 518
pitulated in Christ: 45 God and the world; the Word and the flesh;
eternal life and time; the love that hands itself over and the sin that
betrays it; the disciples present and those who will believe in him
by their word; humiliation and glory. It is the prayer of unity.
820
2749
Jesus fulfilled the work of the Father completely; his
prayer, like his sacrifice, extends until the end of time. The prayer
of this hour fills the end-times and carries them toward their
consummation. Jesus, the Son to whom the Father has given all
things, has given himself wholly back to the Father, yet expresses
himself with a sovereign freedom46 by virtue of the power the
Father has given him over all flesh. The Son, who made himself
Servant, is Lord, the Pantocrator. Our high priest who prays for us
is also the one who prays in us and the God who hears our prayer. 2616
2750
By entering into the holy name of the Lord Jesus we can 2815
accept, from within, the prayer he teaches us: "Our Father! " His
priestly prayer fulfills, from within, the great petitions of the Lord's
Prayer: concern for the Father's name;47 passionate zeal for his
kingdom (glory);48 the accomplishment of the will of the Father, of
his plan of salvation;49 and deliverance from evil.so

Finally, in this prayer Jesus reveals and gives to us the

which is the very mystery of the life of prayer.

2751

240

IN BRIEF

2752

Prayer presupposes an effort, a fight against ourselves
and the wiles of the Tempter. The battle of prayer is
inseparable from the necessary "spiritual battle" to act
habitually according to the Spirit of Christ: we pray as
we live, because we live as we pray.

2753

In the battle of prayer we must confront erroneous

conceptions of prayer, various currents of thought,
and our own experience of failure. We must respond
with humility, trust, and perseverance to these temp­
tations which cast doubt on the usefulness or even the
possibility of prayer.

2754

The principal difficulties in the practice of prayer are
distraction and dryness. The remedy lies in faith, con­
version, and vigilance of heart.

2755

Two frequent temptations threaten prayer: lack of
faith and acedia - a form of depression steliUI'.ing from
lax ascetical practice that leads to discouragement.

2756

Filial trust is put to the test when we feel that our
prayer is not always heard. The Gospel invites us to
ask ourselves about the conformity of our prayer to the
desire of the Spirit.

2757

"Pray constantly" (1 Thess 5: 17). It is always possible
to pray. It is even a vital necessity. Prayer and Chris­
tian life are inseparable.

2758

The prayer of the hour of Jesus, rightly called the
"priestly prayer" (cf. Jn 1 7), sums up the whole econ­
omy of creation and salvation. It fulfills the great
petitions of the Our Father.

51 Cf. Jn 17:3, 6-10, 25.

SECTION Two
THE LORD'S PRAYER
"OUR FATHER! "
2759
Jesus "was praying at a certain place, and when h e ceased,
one of his disciples said to him, 'Lord, teach us to pray, as John
taught his disciples."' 1 In response to this request the Lord entrusts
to his disciples and to his Church the fundamental Christian
prayer. St. Luke presents a brief text of five petitions,2 while St.
Matthew gives a more developed version of seven petitions. 3 The
liturgical tradition of the Church has retained St. Matthew's text:

Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us,
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

Very early on, liturgical usage concluded the Lord's Prayer with
a doxology. In the Didache, we find, "For yours are the power and the glory
'!
for ever." The Apostolic Constitutions add to the beginning: "the kin
dom," and this is the formula retained to our day in ecumenical prayer.
The Byzantine tradition adds after "the glory" the words "Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit." The Roman Missal develops the last petition in the explicit
perspective of "awaitin our blessed hope" and of the Second Coming of
our Lord Jesus Christ. Then comes the assembly's acclamation or the
repetition of the doxology from the Apostolic Constitu tions.

"THE SUMMARY OF THE WHOLE GOSPEL"

2761
The Lord's Prayer "is truly the s umm ary of the whole
gospel." 7 "Since the Lord . . . after handing over the practice of
prayer, said elsewhere, 'Ask and you will receive,' and since eve­
ryone has petitions which are peculiar to his circumstances, the
regular and appropriate prayer [the Lord's Prayer] is said first, as
the foundation of further desires." 8

CENTER O F THE SCRIPllJ RES

2762
After showing how the psalms are the principal food of
Christian prayer and flow together in the petitions of the Our
Father, St. Augustine concludes:
Run through all the words of the holy prayers [in Scripture],

and I do not think that you will find anything in them that
is not contained and included in the Lord's Prayer. 9

All the Scriptures - the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms
102 2763
- are fulfilled in Christ. 10 The Gospel is this "Good News." Its first
proclamation is summarized by St. Matthew in the Sermon on the
Mount; 11 the prayer to our Father is at the center of this proclama­
tion. It is in this context that each petition bequeathed to us by the
Lord is illuminated:
The Lord's Prayer is the most perfect of prayers. . . . In i t we
ask, not only for all the things we can rightly desire, but also
in the sequence that they should be desired. This prayer not
only teaches us to ask for things, but also in what order we
should desire them. 12

2541

1 965 2764
The Sermon on the Mount is teaching for life, the Our
Father is a prayer; but in both the one and the other the Spirit of
the Lord gives new form to our desires, those inner movements
that animate our lives. Jesus teaches us this new life by his words;
1 969 he teaches us to ask for it by our prayer. The rightness of our life in

"THE LORD'S PRAYER"

2765
The traditional expression "the Lord's Prayer" - oratio
Dominica - means that the prayer to our Father is taught and given
to us by the Lord Jesus. The prayer that comes to us from Jesus is
truly unique: it is "of the Lord." On the one hand, in the words of
this prayer the only Son gives us the words the Father gave him: 13 2701
he is the master of our prayer. On the other, as Word incarnate, he
knows in his human heart the needs of his human brothers and
sisters and reveals them to us: he is the model of our prayer.
2766
But Jesus does not give us a formula to repeat mechani­
4
l
cally. As in every vocal prayer, it is through the Word of God that
the Holy Spirit teaches the children of God to pray to their Father.
Jesus not only gives us the words of our filial prayer; at the same
time he gives us the Spirit by whom these words become in us
"spirit and life." 15 Even more, the proof and possibility of our filial
prayer is that the Father "sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts,
crying, 'Abba ! Father!"' 16 Since our prayer sets forth our desires
before God, it is again the Father, "he who searches the hearts of
men," who "knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit
intercedes for the saints according to the will of God." 17 The prayer
to Our Father is inserted into the mysterious mission of the Son and 690
of the Spirit.

THE PRAYER OF THE CHURCH

2767
This indivisible gift of the Lord's words and of the Holy
Spirit who gives life to them in the hearts of believers has been
received and lived by the Church from the beginning. The first
communities prayed the Lord's Prayer three times a day, 18 in place
of the "Eighteen Benedictions" customary in Jewish piety.
2768
According to the apostolic tradition, the Lord's Prayer is
essentially rooted in liturgical prayer:
[The Lord] teaches us to make prayer in common for all our
brethren. For he did not say "my Father" who art in heaven-<
b
but "our" Father, offering petitions for the common Body.

In all the liturgical traditions, the Lord's Prayer is an integral part
of the major hours of the Divine Office. In the three sacraments of
Christian initiation its ecclesial character is especially in evidence:

2769
In Baptism and Confirmation, the handing on (truditio) of the
Lord's Prayer signifies new birth into the divine life. Since Chris1243 tian prayer is our speaking to God with the very word of God, those
who are "born anew . . . through the living and abiding word of
God" 20 learn to invoke their Father by the one Word he always
hears. They can henceforth do so, for the seal of the Holy Spirit's
anointing is indelibly placed on their hearts, ears, lips, indeed their
whole filial being. This is why most of the patristic commentaries
on the Our Father are addressed to catechumens and neophytes.
When the Church prays the Lord's Prayer, it is always the people
made up of the "new-born" who pray and obtain mercy. 21
1350 2770
In the Eucharistic liturgy the Lord's Prayer appears as the
prayer of the whole Church and there reveals its full meaning and
efficacy. Placed between the anaphora (the Eucharistic prayer) and
the communion, the Lord's Prayer sums up on the one hand all the
petitions and intercessions expressed in the movement of the epi­
clesis and, on the other, knocks at the door of the Banquet of the
kingdom which sacramental communion anticipates.
2771
In the Eucharist, the Lord's Prayer also reveals the eschato­
logical character of its petitions. It is the proper prayer of "the
1403 end-time," the time of salvation that began with the outpouring of
the Holy Spirit and will be fulfilled with the Lord's return. The
petitions addressed to our Father, as distinct from the prayers of
the old covenant, rely on the mystery of salvation already accom­
plished, once for all, in Christ crucified and risen.
1 820 2772
From this unshakeable faith springs forth the hope that
sustains each of the seven petitions, which express the groanings
of the present age, this time of patience and expectation during
which "it does not yet appear what we shall be." 22 The Eucharist
and the Lord's Prayer look eagerly for the Lord's return, "until he
comes."23

IN BRIEF

2773

In response to his disciples' request "Lord, teach us to
pray" (Lk 1 1 : 1), Jesus entrusts them with the funda­
mental Christian prayer, the Our Father.

2774

"The Lord's Prayer is truly the summary of the whole
gospe1," 24 the "most perfect of prayers." 25 It is at the
center of the Scriptures.

2775

It is called "the Lord's Prayer" because it comes to us
from the Lord Jesus, the master and model of our
prayer.

2776

The Lord's Prayer is the quintessential prayer of the
Church. It is an integral part of the major hours of the
Divine Office and of the sacraments of Christian initia­
tion: Baptism, Confirmation, and Eucharist. Inte­
grated into the Eucharist it reveals the eschatological
character of its petitions, hoping for the Lord, "until
he comes" (1 Cor 1 1 :26).

"OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN"

"WE DARE TO SAY"

I.

2777
In the Roman liturgy, the Eucharistic assembly is invited
to pray to our heavenly Father with filial boldness; the Eastern
liturgies develop and use similar expressions: " dare in all confi­
dence," "make us worthy of. . . . " From the burning bush Moses
heard a voice saying to him, "Do not come near; put off your shoes
from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy
ground."26 Only Jesus could cross that threshold of the divine
holiness, for "when he had made purification for sins," he brought
us into the Father's presence: "Here am I, and the children God has
given me." 27

Our awareness of our status as slaves would make us sink
into the ground and our earthly condition would dissolve
into dust, if the authority of our Father himself and the Spirit
of his Son had not impelled us to this cry . . . 'Abba, Father! '
. . . When would a mortal dare call God 'Fa ther,' i f man's
innermost being were not animated by power from on
high?" 28

270

This power of the Spirit who introduces us to the Lord's
2778
Prayer is expressed in the liturgies of East and of West by the
beautiful, characteristically Christian expression: parrhesia,
2828 straightforward simplicity, filial trust, joyous assurance, humble
boldness, the certainty of being loved. 29
II.

11F ATHER!"

2779
Before we make our own this first exclamation of the
Lord's Prayer, we must humbly cleanse our hearts of certain false
images drawn "from this world." Humility makes us recognize that
"no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the
Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to
reveal him," that is, "to little children."30 The purification of our
hearts has to do with paternal or maternal images, stemming from
our personal and cultural history, and influencing our relationship
with God. God our Father transcends the categories of the created
239 world. To impose our own ideas in this area "upon him would be
to fabricate idols to adore or pull down. To pray to the Father is to
enter into his mystery as he is and as the Son has revealed him to us.
"

The expression God the Father had never been revealed to
anyone. When Moses himself asked God who he was, he
heard another name. The Father's name has been revealed
to us in the Son, for the name "Son" implies the new name
"Father." 31

240 2780
We can invoke God as "Father" because he is revealed to us
by his Son become man and because his Spirit makes him known
to us. The personal relation of the Son to the Father is something
that man cannot conceive of nor the angelic powers even dimly see:
and yet, the Spirit of the Son grants a participation in that very
relation to us who believe that Jesus is the Christ and that we are
born of God. 32

667

2781
When we pray to the Father, we are in communion with him 2665
and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 33 Then we know and recognize him
with an ever new sense of wonder. The first phrase of the Our
Father is a blessing of adoration before it is a supplication. For it is
the glory of God that we should recognize him as "Father," the true
God. We give him thanks for having revealed his name to us, for
the gift of believing in it, and for the indwelling of his Presence in
us.
2782
We can adore the Father because he has caused us to be
reborn to his life by adopting us as his children in his only Son: by
Baptism, he incorporates us into the Body of his Christ; through 1267
the anointing of his Spirit who flows from the head to the members,
he makes us other "Christs."
God, indeed, who has predestined us to adoption as his sons,
has conformed us to the glorious Body of Christ. So then you
who have become sharers in Christ are appropriately called
"Christs." 34
The new man, reborn and restored to his God by grace , says
first of all, "Father! " because he has now begun to be a son.35

2783
Thus the Lord's Prayer reveals us to ourselves at the same 1 701
time that it reveals the Father to us.3 6
0 man, you did not dare to raise your face to heaven, you

lowered your eyes to the earth, and suddenly you have received
the grace of Christ all your sins have been forgiven. From being
a wicked servant you have become a good son . . . . Then raise
your eyes to the Father who has begotten you through Baptism,
to the Father who has redeemed you through his Son, and say:
"Our Father. . . . " But do not claim any privilege. He is the Father
in a special way only of Christ, but he is the common Father of
us all, because while he has begotten only Christ, he has created
us. Then also say by his grace, "Our Father," so that you may
merit being his son?7

2784
The free gift of adoption requires on our part continual 1428
conversion and new life. Praying to our Father should develop in
us two fundamental dispositions:
First, the desire to become like him: though created in his
image, we are restored to his likeness by grace; and we must 1 997
respond to this grace.

We must remember . . . and know that when we call God
"our Father " we ought to behave as sons of God . 38
You cannot call the God of all kindness your Father if you
preserve a cruel and inhuman heart; for in this case you no
longer have in you the marks of the heavenly Father's kind­
9
ness. 3
We must contemplate the beauty of the Father without
0
ceasing and adorn our own souls accordingly. 4

Second, a humble and trusting heart that enables us "to tum
2562 2785
and become like children": 41 for it is to "little children" that the
Father is revealed. 42
[The prayer is accomplished] by the contemplation of God
alone, and by the warmth of love, through which the soul,
molded and directed to love him, speaks very familiarly to
God as to its own Father with special devotion. 43
Our Father: at this name love is aroused in us . . . and the
confidence of obtaining what we are about to ask. . . . What
would he not give to his children who ask, since he has
44
already granted them the gift of being his children?

III.

"OUR" FATHER

2786
"Our" Father refers to God. The adjective, as used by us,
does not express possession, but an entirely new relationship with
God.

2787
When we say "our" Father, we recognize first that all his
promises of love announced by the prophets are fulfilled in the new
782 and eternal covenant in his Christ: we have become "his" people and
he is henceforth "our" God. This new relationship is the purely
gratuitous gift of belonging to each other: we are to respond to
"grace and truth" given us in Jesus Christ with love and faithful­
ness. 45

Christian Prayer

669

2788
Since the Lord's Prayer is that of his people in the "end­
time," this "our" also expresses the certitude of our hope in God's
ultimate promise: in the new Jerusalem he will say to the victor, "I
will be his God and he shall be my son." 46
2789
When we pray to "our" Father, we personally address the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. By doing so we do not divide the
Godhead, since the Father is its "source and origin," but rather
confess that the Son is eternally begotten by him and the Holy Spirit
proceeds from him. We are not confusing the persons, for we
confess that our communion is with the Father and his Son, Jesus
Christ, in their one Holy Spirit. The Holy Trinity is consubstantial
and indivisible. When we pray to the Father, we adore and glorify
him together with the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Grammatically, "our" qualifies a reality common to more
2790
than one person. There is only one God, and he is recognized as
Father by those who, through faith in his only Son, are reborn of
him by water and the Spirit. 47 The Church is this new communion
of God and men. United with the only Son, who has become "the
firstborn among many brethren," she is in communion with one
and the same Father in one and the same Holy Spirit. 48 In praying
"our" Father, each of the baptized is praying in this communion:
"The company of those who believed were of one heart and
soul." 49

2791
For this reason, in spite of the divisions among Christians,
this prayer to "our" Father remains our common patrimony and
an urgent summons for all the baptized. In communion by faith in
Christ and by Baptism, they ought to join in Jesus' prayer for the
unity of his disciples.50
2792
Finally, if we pray the Our Father sincerely, we leave
individualism behind, because the love that we receive frees us
from it. The "our" at the beginning of the Lord's Prayer, like the
"us" of the last four petitions, excludes no one. If we are to say it
truthfully, our divisions and oppositions have to be overcome.51

The baptized cannot pray to "our" Father without bring­
ing before him all those for whom he gave his beloved Son. God's
love has no bounds, neither should our prayer.52 Praying "our"
Father opens to us the dimensions of his love revealed in Christ:
praying with and for all who do not yet know him, so that Christ
may " gather into one the children of God."53 God's care for all men
and for the whole of creation has inspired all the great practitioners
of prayer; it should extend our prayer to the full breadth of love
whenever we dare to say "our" Father.

"WHO ART IN HEAVEN"

2794
This biblical expression does not mean a place ("space"),
but a way of being; it does not mean that God is distant, but
majestic. Our Father is not "elsewhere": he transcends everything
we can conceive of his holiness. It is precisely because he is thrice­
holy that he is so close to the humble and contrite heart.
"Our Father who art in heaven" is rightly understood to
mean that God is in the hearts of the just, as in his holy
temple. At the same time, it means that those who pray
should desire the one they invoke to dwell in them.54
"Heaven" could also be those who bear the image of the
heavenly world, and in whom God dwells and tarries. 55

1 024

2795
The symbol of the heavens refers us back to the mystery of
the covenant we are living when we pray to our Father. He is in
heaven, his dwelling place; the Father's house is our homeland. Sin
has exiled us from the land of the covenant,56 but conversion of
heart enables us to return to the Father, to heaven .57 In Christ, then,
heaven and earth are reconciled,58 for the Son alone "descended
from heaven" and causes us to ascend there with him, by his Cross,
Resurrection, and Ascension.59

Christian Prayer

2796
When the Church prays "our Father who art in heaven,"
she is professing that we are the People of God, already seated
"with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus" and "hidden with
Christ in God;" 60 yet at the same time, "here indeed we groan, and
long to put on our heavenly dwelling." 61
[Christians] are in the flesh, but do not live according to the
flesh. They spend their lives on earth, but are citizens of
heaven. 62

IN BRIEF

2797

Simple and faithful trust, humble and joyous assur­
ance are the proper dispositions for one who prays the
Our Father.

2798

We can invoke God as "Father" because the Son of
God made man has revealed him to us. In this Son,
through Baptism, we are incorporated and adopted as
sons of God.

2799

The Lord's Prayer brings us into communion with the
Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. At the same time
it reveals us to ourselves (cf. GS 22 § 1).

2800

Praying to our Father should develop in us the will to
become like him and foster in us a humble and trusting
heart.

2801

When we say "Our" Father, we are invoking the new
covenant in Jesus Christ, communion with the Holy
Trinity, and the divine love which spreads through the
Church to encompass the world.

2802

"Who art in heaven" does not refer to a place but to
God's majesty and his presence in the hearts of the just.
Heaven, the Father's house, is the true homeland to­
ward which we are heading and to which, already, we
belong.

ARTICLE 3
THE SEVEN PETITIONS

2627

After we have placed ourselves in the presence of God our
2803
Father to adore and to love and to bless him, the Spirit of adoption
stirs up in our hearts seven petitions, seven blessings. The first
three, more theologal, draw us toward the glory of the Father; the
last four, as ways toward him, commend our wretchedness to his
grace. "Deep calls to deep." 63

2804
The first series of petitions carries us toward him , for his
own sake: thy name, thy kingdom, thy will! It is characteristic of
love to think first of the one whom we love. In none of the three
petitions do we mention ourselves; the burning desire, even an­
guish, of the beloved Son for his Father's glory seizes us:64 "hal­
lowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done . . . . " These
three supplications were already answered in the saving sacrifice
of Christ, but they are henceforth directed in hope toward their
final fulfilhnent, for God is not yet all in all. 65

1 1 05

2805
The second series of petitions unfolds with the same
movement as certain Eucharistic epicleses: as an offering up of
our expectations, that draws down upon itself the eyes of the
Father of mercies. They go up from us and concern us from this
very moment, in our present world: "give us . forgive us . .
lead us not . . . deliver us . . . . " The fourth and fifth petitions
concern our life as such - to be fed and to be healed of sin; the
last two concern our battle for the victory of life - that battle of
prayer.
.

2 656-2 658

.

.

2806
By the three first petitions, we are strengthened in faith,
filled with hope, and set aflame by charity. Being creatures and still
sinners, we have to petition for us, for that "us" bound by the world
and history, which we offer to the boundless love of God. For
through the name of his Christ and the reign of his Holy Spirit, our
Father accomplishes his plan of salvation, for us and for the whole
world.

"HALLOWED BE THY NAME"

2807 The term "to hallow" is to be understood here not primar­
ily in its causative sense (only God hallows, makes holy), but above
all in an evaluative sense: to recognize as holy, to treat in a holy
way. And so, in adoration, this invocation is sometimes understood as praise and thanksgiving. 66 But this petition is here taught
to us by Jesus as an optative: a petition, a desire, and an expectation
in which God and man are involved. Beginning with this first
petition to our Father, we are immersed in the innermost mystery
of his Godhead and the drama of the salvation of our humanity.
Asking the Father that his name be made holy draws us into his
plan of loving kindness for the fullness of time, "according to his
purpose which he set forth in Christ," that we might "be holy and
blameless before him in love."67

2 1 42-2 1 59

2097

2808
In the decisive moments of his economy God reveals his
name, but he does so by accomplishing his work. This work, then,
is realized for us and in us only if his name is hallowed by us and
in us.
2809
The holiness of God is the inaccessible center of his eternal
mystery. What is revealed of it in creation and history, Scripture
calls "glory," the radiance of his majesty. 68 In making man in his
image and likeness, God " crowned him with glory and honor," but
by sinning, man fell "short of the glory of God." 69 From that time
on, God was to manifest his holiness by revealing and giving his
name, in order to restore man to the image of his Creator. 7°
2810
In the promise to Abraham and the oath that accompanied
it, 71 God commits himself but without disclosing his name. He
begins to reveal it to Moses and makes it known clearly before the
eyes of the whole people when he saves them from the Egyptians:
"he has triumphed gloriously." 72 From the covenant of Sinai on­
wards, this people is "his own" and it is to be a "holy (or "conse­
crated": the same word is used for both in Hebrew) nation," 73
because the name of God dwells in it.

In spite of the holy Law that again and again their Holy
God gives them - "You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am
holy" - and although the Lord shows patience for the sake of his
name, the people tum away from the Holy One of Israel and
profane his name among the nations. 74 For this reason the just ones
of the old covenant, the poor survivors returned from exile, and
the prophets burned with passion for the name.
434 2812
Finally, in Jesus the name of the Holy God is revealed and
given to us, in the flesh, as Savior, revealed by what he is, by his
word, and by his sacrifice. 75 This is the heart of his priestly prayer:
"Holy Father . . . for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also
may be consecrated in truth." 76 Because he "sanctifies" his own
name, Jesus reveals to us the name of the FatherF At the end of
Christ's Passover, the Father gives him the name that is above all
names: "Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." 78
2013 2813
In the waters of Baptism, we have been "washed . .
sanctified . . . justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in
the Spirit of our God." 79 Our Father calls us to holiness in the whole
of our life, and since "he is the source of [our] life in Christ Jesus,
who became for us wisdom from God, and . . . sanctification,"80
both his glory and our life depend on the hallowing of his name in
us and by us. Such is the urgency of our first petition.

By whom is God hallowed, since he is the one who hallows?
But since he said, "You shall be holy to me; for I the LORD

name is blessed when we live well, but is blasphemed when
we live wickedly. As the Apostle says: "The name of God is
blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you." We ask
then that, just as the name of God is holy, so we may obtain
his holiness in our souls. 82
When we say "hallowed be thy name," we ask that it should
be hallowed in us, who are in him; but also in others whom
God's grace still awaits, that we may obey the precept that
obliges us to pray for everyone, even our enemies. That is
why we do not say expressly "hallowed be thy name ' in us,"'
for we ask that it be so in all men. 83

This petition embodies all the others. Like the six petitions
2815
that follow, it is fulfilled by the prayer of Christ. Prayer to our Father
is our prayer, if it is prayed in the name of Jesus. 84 In his priestly 2750
prayer, Jesus asks: "Holy Father, protect in your name those whom
you have given me." 85

"THY KINGDOM COME"

2816
In the New Testament, the word basileia can be translated
by "kingship" (abstract noun), "kingdom" (concrete noun) or
"reign" (action noun). The Kingdom of God lies ahead of us. It is
brought near in the Word incarnate, it is proclaimed throughout
the whole Gospel, and it has come in Christ's death and Resurrection. The Kingdom of God has been coming since the Last Supper
and, in the Eucharist, it is in our midst. The kingdom will come in
glory when Christ hands it over to his Father:

541

It may even be . . . that the Kingdom of God means Christ
himself, whom we daily desire to come, and whose coming
we wish to be manifested quickly to us. For as he is our
resurrection, since in him we rise, so he can also be under­
stood as the Kingdom of God, for in him we shall reign. 86

2817
This petition is "Marana tha, " the cry of the Spirit and the 451, 2632
Bride: "Come, Lord Jesus."
671
Even if it had not been prescribed to pray for the coming of
the kingdom, we would willingly have brought forth this
speech, eager to embrace our hope. In indignation the souls
of the martyrs under the altar cry out to the Lord: "0 Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you judge and
avenge our blood on those who dwell upon the earth?" For

In the Lord's Prayer, "thy kingdom come" refers primarily

to the final coming of the reign of God through Christ's retu m . 88
But, far from distracting the Church from her mission in this
present world, this desire commits her to it all the more strongly.

Since Pentecost, the coming of that Reign is the work of the Spirit
of the Lord who "complete[s] his work on earth and brings us the
fullness of grace. n 89

2046 2819

" The kingdom of God [is] righteousness and peace and joy

in the Holy Spirit." 90 The end-time in which we live is the a ge of

251 6

the outpouring of the Spirit. Ever since Pentecost, a decisive battle

has been joined between "the flesh" and the Spirit. 9 1

Only a pure soul can boldly say: "Thy kingdom come." One
who has heard Paul say, "Let not sin therefore reign in your
mortal bodies," and has purified himself in action thought,
9
and word will say to God: "Thy kingdom come!" 2

2820

By a discernment according to the Spirit, Christians have

to distinguish between the growth of the Reign of God and the

1 049

progress of the culture and society in which they are involved. This
distinction is not a separation. Man's vocation to eternal life does
not suppress, but actually reinforces, his duty to put into action in
this world the energies and means received from the Creator to
serve justice and peace. 93

"THY WILL B E DONE ON EARTH AS IT I S IN HEAVEN"

2822
Our Father " desires all men to be saved and to come to the 851
knowledge of the truth." 95 He "is forbearing toward you, not
wishing that any should perish." 96 His commandment is "that you
love one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one 2 1 96
another. "97 This commandment summarizes all the others and
expresses his entire will.
2823
"He has made known to us the mystery of his will, accord- 59
ing to his good pleasure that he set forth in Christ . . . to gather up
all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth. In Christ
we have also obtained an inheritance, having been destined ac­
cording to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel and will." 98 We ask insistently for this loving
plan to be fully realized on earth as it is already in heaven.
2824
In Christ, and through his human will, the will of the 475
Father has been perfectly fulfilled once for all. Jesus said on entering into this world: "Lo, I have come to do your will, 0 God." 99
Only Jesus can say: "I always do what is pleasing to him." 100 In the
prayer of his agony, he consents totally to this will: "not my will,
but yours be done." 101 For this reason Jesus "gave himself for our 612
sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of
our God and Father." l 02 "And by that will we have been sanctified
through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all." 103
2825
" Although he was a Son, [Jesus] learned obedience
through what he suffered." 104 How much more reason have we
sinful creatures to learn obedience - we who in him have become
children of adoption. We ask our Father to unite our will to his
Son's, in order to fulfill his will, his plan of salvation for the life of 615
the world. We are radically incapable of this, but united with Jesus
and with the power of his Holy Spirit, we can surrender our will
to him and decide to choose what his Son has always chosen: to do
what is pleasing to the Father. 105

In committing ourselves to [Christ], we can become one
spirit with him, and thereby accomplish his will, in such wise
that it will be perfect on earth as it is in heaven. 106
Consider how Uesus Christ] teaches us to be humble, by
making us see that our virtue does not depend on our work
alone but on grace from on high. He commands each of the
faithful who prays to do so universally, for the whole world.
For he did not say "thy will be done in me or in us," but "on
earth," the whole earth, so that error may be banished from
it, truth take root in it, all vice be destroyed on it, virtue
flourish on it, and earth no longer differ from heaven. 107

By prayer we can discern "what is the will of God" and
2826
obtain the endurance to do it. 108 Jesus teaches us that one enters
the kingdom of heaven not by speaking words, but by doing "the
will of my Father in heaven." 109

261 1 2827
"If any one is a worshiper of God and does his will, God
listens to him." 110 Such is the power of the Church's prayer in the
name of her Lord, above all in the Eucharist. Her prayer is also a
communion of intercession with the all-holy Mother of God 111 and
all the saints who have been pleasing to the Lord because they
willed his will alone:
It would not be inconsistent with the truth to understand the
words, "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven," to
mean: "in the Church as in our Lord Jesus Christ himself";
or "in the Bride who has been betrothed, just as in the
Bridegroom who has accomplished the will of the Fa­

"G IVE Us THIS DAY OUR DAILY B READ"

"Give us": The trust of children who look to their Father for 2778
everything is beautiful. "He makes his sun rise on the evil and on
the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. " 113 He gives
to all the living "their food in due season." 114 Jesus teaches us this
petition, because it glorifies our Father by acknowledging how
good he is, beyond all goodness.
2829
"Give us" also expresses the covenant. We are his and he
is ours, for our sake. But this "us" also recognizes him as the Father
of all men and we pray to him for them all, in solidarity with their 1 939
needs and sufferings.
2830
"Our bread": The Father who gives us life cannot but give
us the nourishment life requires - all appropriate goods and blessings, both material and spiritual. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus 2633
insists on the filial trust that cooperates with our Father's provi­
dence. 115 He is not inviting us to idleness, l 16 but wants to relieve
us from nagging worry and preoccupation. Such is the filial sur­
render of the children of God:
To those who seek the kingdom of God and his righteous­
ness, he has promised to give all else besides. Since everything indeed belongs to God, he who possesses God wants
for nothing, i f he himself is n o t found wanting before
God . 1 1 7

But the presence of those who hunger because they lack
bread opens up another profound meaning of this petition. The

to exercise responsibility toward their brethren, both in their per­

As leaven in the dough, the newness of the kingdom
should make the earth "rise" by the Spirit of Christ.1 19 This must
1 928 be shown by the establishment of justice in personal and social,
economic and international relations, without ever forgetting that
there are no just structures without people who want to be just.
2790 2833
"Our" bread is the "one" loaf for the "many." In the
2546 Beatitudes "poverty" is the virtue of sharing: it calls us to commu­
nicate and share both material and spiritual goods, not by coercion
but out of love, so that the abundance of some may remedy the
needs of others. 120
2428 2834
"Pray and work." 12 1 "Pray as if everything depended on
God and work as if everything depended on you." 1 22 Even when
we have done our work, the food we receive is still a gift from our
Father; it is good to ask him for it and to thank him, as Christian
families do when saying grace at meals.
2835
This petition, with the responsibility it involves, also ap­
plies to another hunger from which men are perishing: "Man does
not live by bread alone, but . . . by every word that proceeds from
the mouth of God," 123 that is, by the Word he speaks and the Spirit
he breathes forth. Christians must make every effort " to proclaim
2443 the good news to the poor." There is a famine on earth, "not a
famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of
the LORD." 124 For this reason the specifically Christian sense of this
fourth petition concerns the Bread of Life: The Word of God ac1 384 cepted in faith, the Body of Christ received in the Eucharist. 1 25
1 1 65 2836
"This day" is also an expression of trust taught us by the
Lord, 126 which we would never have presumed to invent. Since it
refers above all to his Word and to the Body of his Son, this "today"
is not only that of our mortal time, but also the "today" of God.
If you receive the bread each day, each day is today for you.
If Christ is yours today, he rises for you every day. How can
this be? "You are my Son, today I have begotten you. "
Therefore, "today" i s when Christ rises. 127

"Daily" (epiousios) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. Taken in a temporal sense, this word is a pedagogical repetition of "this day," 128 to confirm us in trust "without reservation."
Taken in the qualitative sense, it signifies what is necessary for life,
and more broadly every good thing sufficient for subsistence. 129
Taken literally (epi-ousios: "super-essential"), it refers directly to the
Bread of Life, the Body of Christ, the "medicine of immortality,"
without which we have no life within us. 130 Finally in this connection, its heavenly meaning is evident: "this day" is the Day of the
Lord, the day of the feast of the kingdom, anticipated in the
Eucharist that is already the foretaste of the kingdom to come. For
this reason it is fitting for the Eucharistic liturgy to be celebrated

The Eucharist is our daily bread. The power belonging to this
divine food makes it a bond of union. Its effect is then
understood as unity, so that, gathered into his Body and
made members of him, we may become what we receive. . . .
This also is our daily bread: the readings you hear each day
in church and the hymns you hear and sing. All these are
necessities for our pilgrimage. l 31
The Father in heaven urges us, as children of heaven, to ask
for the bread of heaven. [Christ] himself is the bread who,
sown in the Virgin, raised up in the flesh, kneaded in the
Passion, baked in the oven of the tomb, reserved in churches,
brought to altars, furnishes the faithful each day with food
from heaven. 132

This petition is astonishing. If it consisted only of the first 1425

since Christ's sacrifice is "that sins may be forgiven." But, accord- 1 933

have first met a strict requirement. Our petition looks to the future,
but our response must come first, for the two parts are joined by 2631

And forgi v e us our trespasses

2839
With bold confidence, we began praying to our Father. In
begging him that his name be hallowed, we were in fact asking him
that we ourselves might be always made more holy. But though
1425 we are clothed with the baptismal garment, we do not cease to sin,
1439 to tum away from God. Now, in this new petition, we return to
him like the prodigal son and, like the tax collector, recognize that
we are sinners before him. 133 Our petition begins with a "confes­
sion" of our wretchedness and his mercy. Our hope is firm because,
in his Son, "we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins:· 134 We
find the efficacious and undoubted sign of his forgiveness in the
1422 sacraments of his Church. 135
2840
Now - and this is daunting - this outpouring of mercy
cannot penetrate our hearts as long as we have not forgiven those
who have trespassed against us. Love, like the Body of Christ, is
indivisible; we cannot love the God we cannot see if we do not love
the brother or sister we do see. 136 In refusing to forgive our brothers
and sisters, our hearts are closed and their hardness makes them
1 864 impervious to the Father's merciful love; but in confessing our sins,
our hearts are opened to his grace.
2841
This petition is so important that it is the only one to which
the Lord returns and which he develops explicitly in the Sermon
on the Mount. l 37 This crucial requirement of the covenant mystery
is impossible for man. But "with God all things are possible." 138
. . . as we forgive those who trespass against us

2842
This "as" is not unique in Jesus' teaching: "You, therefore,
must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect"; "Be merciful,
even as your Father is merciful"; "A new commandment I give to
you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you
also love one another." 139 It is impossible to keep the Lord's
commandment by imitating the divine model from outside; there
52 1 has to be a vital participation, coming from the depths of the heart,
in the holiness and the mercy and the love of our God. Only the

Spirit by whom we live can make "ours" the same mind that was
in Christ Jesus. 140 Then the unity of forgiveness becomes possible
and we find ourselves "forgiving one another, as God in Christ
forgave" us. 141

2843
Thus the Lord's words on forgiveness, the love that loves
to the end, 142 become a living reality. The parable of the merciless
servant, which crowns the Lord's teaching on ecclesial communion, ends with these words: "So also my heavenly Father will do to
every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your
heart." 143 It is there, in fact, "in the depths of the heart," that
everything is bound and loosed. It is not in our power not to feel
or to forget an offense; but the heart that offers itself to the Holy
Spirit turns injury into compassion and purifies the memory in
transforming the hurt into intercession.
2844
Christian prayer extends to the forgiveness of enemies,l 44

transfiguring the disciple by configuring him to his Master. For­
giveness is a high-point of Christian prayer; only hearts attuned to
God's compassion can receive the gift of prayer. Forgiveness also
bears witness that, in our world, love is stronger than sin. The
martyrs of yesterday and today bear this witness to Jesus. Forgiveness is the fundamental condition of the reconciliation of the
children of God with their Father and of men with one another. 145

2845
There is no limit or measure to this essentially divine 1441
forgiveness, 146 whether one speaks of "sins" as in Luke ( 1 1 :4), or
"debts" as in Matthew (6:12). We are always debtors: "Owe no one
anything, except to love one another." 147 The communion of the
Holy Trinity is the source and criterion of truth in every relationship. It is lived out in prayer, above all in the Eucharist. 148
God does not accept the sacrifice of a sower of disunion, but
commands that he depart from the altar so that he may first
be reconciled with his brother. For God can be appeased only
by prayers that make peace. To God, the better offering is
peace, brotherly concord, and a peo le made one in the unity
of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. 49

"AND LEAD U s NoT INTO TEMPTATION"

2846
This petition goes to the root of the preceding one, for our
sins result from our consenting to temptation; we therefore ask our
164 Father not to "lead" us into temptation. It is difficult to translate
the Greek verb used by a single English word: the Greek means
both "do not allow us to enter into temptation" and "do not let us
yield to temptation." 150 "God cannot be tempted by evil and he
himself tempts no one"; 151 on the contrary, he wants to set us free
from evil. We ask him not to allow us to take the way that leads to
251 6 sin. We are engaged in the battle "between flesh and spirit"; this
petition implores the Spirit of discernment and strength.
2847
The Holy Spirit makes us discern between trials, which are
necessary for the growth of the inner man, 152 and temptation,
which leads to sin and death.l 53 We must also discern between
2284 being tempted and consenting to temptation. Finally, discernment
unmasks the lie of temptation, whose object appears to be good, a
"delight to the eyes" and desirable,l 54 when in reality its fruit is
death.
God does not want to impose the good, but wants free
beings . . . . There is a certain usefulness to temptation. No
one but God knows what our soul has received from him,
not even we ourselves. But temptation reveals it in order to
teach us to know ourselves, and in this way we discover our
evil inclinations and are obliged to �ive thanks for the goods
that temptation has revealed to us. 55

"Lead us not into temptation" implies a decision ofthe heart:
2848
"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. . . . No
one can serve two masters. " 156 "If we live by the Spirit, let us also
walk by the Spirit." 157 In this assent to the Holy Spirit the Father
gives us strength. "No testing has overtaken you that is not com1 808 mon to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted
beyond your strength, but with the temptation will also provide
the way of escape, so that you may be able to endure it." 158

Such a battle and such a victory become possible only
through prayer. It is by his prayer that Jesus vanquishes the
tempter, both at the outset of his public mission and in the ultimate
struggle of his agony159 In this petition to our heavenly Father,
Christ unites us to his battle and his agony. He urges us to vigilance 540, 612
of the heart in communion with his own. Vigilance is "custody of
the heart," and Jesus prayed for us to the Father: "Keep them in 2612
your name." 160 The Holy Spirit constantly seeks to awaken us to
keep watch. 161 Finally, this petition takes on all its dramatic meaning in relation to the last temptation of our earthly battle; it asks for
final perseverance. "Lo, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is he who
1 62
is awake." 162
"BUT DELIVER Us FROM EVIL"

VII.

2850
The last petition to our Father is also included in Jesus'
prayer: "I am not asking you to take them out of the world, but I
ask you to protect them from the evil one." 163 It touches each of us
personally, but it is always "we" who pray, in communion with
the whole Church, for the deliverance of the whole human family.
The Lord's Prayer continually opens us to the range of God's
economy of salvation. Our interdependence in the drama of sin and
death is turned into solidarity in the Body of Christ, the "commun- 309
ion of saints." 164
2851
In this petition, evil is not an abstraction, but refers to a
person, Satan, the Evil One, the angel who opposes God. The devil
(dia-bolos) is the one who "throws himself across" God's plan and 391
his work of salvation accomplished in Christ.
2852
"A murderer from the beginning, . . . a liar and the father
of lies," Satan is "the deceiver of the whole world." 165 Through him
sin and death entered the world and by his definitive defeat all
creation will be "freed from the corruption of sin and death." 166
Now "we know that anyone born of God does not sin, but He who
was born of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him .

We know that we are of God, and the whole world is in the power
of the evil one." 167
The Lord who has taken away your sin and pardoned your
faults also protects you and keeps you from the wiles of your
adversary the d evil, so that the enemy, who is accustomed
to leading into sin, may not surprise you. One who entrusts
himself to God does not dread the devil. "If God is for us,
who is against us?" 168

677 2853
Victory over the "prince of this world" 169 was won once
for all at the Hour when Jesus freely gave himself up to death to
give us his life. This is the judgment of this world, and the prince
of this world is "cast out." 170 "He pursued the wornan" 171 but had
no hold on her: the new Eve, "full of grace" of the Holy Spirit, is
490 preserved from sin and the corruption of death (the Immaculate
972 Conception and the Assumption of the Most Holy Mother of God,
Mary, ever virgin). "Then the dragon was angry with the woman,
and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring." 172 Therefore
the Spirit and the Church pray: "Corne, Lord Jesus," 173 since his
corning will deliver us from the Evil One.
2854
When we ask to be delivered from the Evil One, we pray
as well to be freed from all evils, present, past, and future, of which
he is the author or instigator. In this final petition, the Church
brings before the Father all the distress of the world. Along with
deliverance from the evils that overwhelm humanity, she implores
the precious gift of peace and the grace of perseverance in expec2632 tation of Christ's return. By praying in this way, she anticipates in
humility of faith the gathering together of everyone and everything
in him who has "the keys of Death and Hades," who "is and who
was and who is to come, the Alrnighty." 174

Deliver us, Lord, we beseech you, from every evil and grant

be ever free from sin and protected from all anxiety, as we

Christ. 175

ARTICLE 4
THE FINAL DOXOLOGY

2855
The final doxology, "For the kingdom, the power and the 2760
glory are yours, now and forever," takes up again, by inclusion, the
first three petitions to our Father: the glorification of his name, the
corning of his reign, and the power of his saving will. But these
prayers are now proclaimed as adoration and thanksgiving, as in
the liturgy of heaven. 176 The ruler of this world has mendaciously
attributed to himself the three titles of kingship, power, and
glory.I 77 Christ, the Lord, restores them to his Father and our
Father, until he hands over the kingdom to him when the mystery
of salvation will be brought to its completion and God will be all
in alP 78
"Then, after the prayer is over you say 'Amen,' which 1061-1065
means 'So be it,' thus ratifying with our 'Amen' what is contained
in the prayer that God has taught us." 1 79

2856

IN BRIEF
2857

In the Our Father, the object of the first three petitions
is the glory of the Father: the sanctification of his name,
the corning of the kingdom, and the fulfillm ent of his
will. The four others present our wants to him: they
ask that our lives be nourished, healed of sin, and
made victorious in the struggle of good over evil.

Domine, ab omnibus malis, da prapitius pacem in diebus nostris, ut, ape

securi: expectantes beatam spem et adventum Salvatoris nostri Iesu Christi.

Part Four

2858

By asking "hallowed be thy name" we enter into God's
plan, the sanctification of his name - revealed first to
Moses and then in Jesus - by us and in us, in every
nation and in each man.

2859

By the second petition, the Church looks first to
Christ's return and the final coming of the Reign of
God. It also prays for the growth of the Kingdom of
God in the "today" of our own lives.

2860

In the third petition, we ask our Father to unite our will
to that of his Son, so as to fulfill his plan of salvation
in the life of the world.

2861

In the fourth petition, by saying "give us," we express
in communion with our brethren our filial trust in our
heavenly Father. "Our daily bread" refers to the
earthly nourishment necessary to everyone for subsis­
tence, and also to the Bread of Life: the Word of God
and the Body of Christ. It is received in God's "today,"
as the indispensable, (super-) essential nourishment of
the feast of the coming Kingdom anticipated in the
Eucharist .

2862

The fifth petition begs God's mercy for our offences,
mercy which can penetrate our hearts only if we have
learned to forgive our enemies, with the example and
help of Christ.

2863

When we say "lead us not into temptation" we are
asking God not to allow us to take the path that leads
to sin. This petition implores the Spirit of discernment
and strength; it requests the grace of vigilance and
final perseverance.

2864

In the last petition, "but deliver us from evil," Chris­
tians pray to God with the Church to show forth the
victory, already won by Christ, over the "ruler of this
world," Satan, the angel personally opposed to God
and to his plan of salvation.

2865

By the final " Amen," we express our "fiat" concerning
the seven petitions: "So be it."

INDEX
Prefatory Note t o Index

The following index is an English translation of the Index A nalyticus that
appeared in the Latin typical edition of the Catechism ofthe Catholic Church,
promulgated on August 15, 1997. For the most part, this index is a literal
rendering of the Latin, with attention given to maintaining consistency
with the language of the English edition of the Catechism of the Catholic
Church. The Index Analyticus was designed to be both a general subject
index as well as a conceptual index of the contents of the Catechism, and
this English translation is faithful to that design. This English translation
does not participate in the approval of the Latin typical edition given in
the apostolic letter Laetamur Magnopere of Pope John Paul II, by which the
Latin text was approved and promulgated .

GLOSSARY
P refatory note to the Glossary
Even before the promulgation of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, a
Glossary had been proposed to provide assistance to those who would use
the new Catechism . This Glossary has been prepared by Archbishop
William J. Levada, who served as a member of the Editorial Committee of
the Special Commission of the Holy See for the Catechism of the Catholic
Church. It has been reviewed by the NCCB ad hoc Committee to Oversee
the Use of the Catechism, as well as by the chairman and staff of the NCCB
Committee on Doctrine.
This Glossary has been composed with reference to the language of the
Catechism itself: the numbers in parentheses refer to the number(s) in the
Catechism where the term or concept is explained. The criterion for the
selection of words included in this Glossary is twofold: (1) unfamiliar or
technical terms are defined, in order to assist readers who are not
acquainted with them through formal religious or theological studies; and
(2) multiple meanings or uses of familiar terms are presented, thus alerting
readers to the various uses of the term in Church doctrine. Common words
and most proper names are not l isted in this Glossary, nor are religious
terms which are not directly or indirectly present in the Catechism.
It is important to remember that this Glossary, like the Catechism's
Indexes, is an additional instrument by which readers may find assistance
in their use of the Catechism itself. While the Glossary is faithful to the
language of the Catechism, it does not participate in the approval of the text
of the Catechism given in the Apostolic Constitution fidei depositum of Pope
John Paul II.
-

A

-

AB ORTI ON: Deliberate
termination of pregnancy by
killing the unborn child. Such
direct abortion, willed either as an
end or a means, is gravely
contrary to the moral law. The
Church attaches the canonical
penalty of excommunication to
this crime against human life

(2271-2).
ABRAHAM: The man of faith
and patriarch of Israel with whom
God made a covenant which
promised him land in which to
live and many descendants, a

great people for whom the Lord
would be their God. Through
Abraham God formed the people
to whom he would later give the
law by revelation to Moses. With
the advent of Christ, the people of
Israel would serve as the root to
which the Gentiles would be
grafted by their coming to believe

(59, 72, 145, 705, 762, 2570).
ABS OLUTI ON: An essential
element of the Sacrament of
Penance in which the priest, by
the power entrusted to the
Church by Christ, pardons the
sin(s) of the penitent (1424, 1442,
1449, 1453, 1480).

Glossnn;
ACEDIA: A less common
synonym for sloth, one of the
seven "capital" sins (1866). See
Sloth.

ACOLYfE: A liturgical minister
appointed to assist at liturgical
celebrations. Priests and deacons
receive this ministry before they
are ordained. Lay men may be
installed permanently in the
ministry of acolyte through a rite
of institution and blessing (903,

1672).
ADAM: According to the creation
story in Genesis, the first man.
From this story the Church has
learned that humanity was
originally created in a state of
holiness and justice and that the
first ancestors of the human race
lost this state for themselves and
all humanity by their sin
("original sin"). Christ is called
the "second" or "new Adam"
because he ushered in the new
creation by forgiving sin and
restoring humanity to the grace of
God's friendship lost by original
sin (359, 375, 388, 390, 402-4, 504;
cf. 635, 655).
AD ORATI ON: The acknowl­
edgment of God as God, Creator
and Savior, the Lord and Master
of everything that exists. Through
worship and prayer, the Church
and individual persons give to
God the adoration which is the
first act of the virtue of religion.
The first commandment of the
law obliges us to adore God (2096,
2628; cf. 1083).

ADULTERY: Marital infidelity, or
sexual relations between two
partners, a t least one of whom is
married to another party. The
sixth commandment and the New

865
Testament forbid adultery
absolutely (2380; cf. 1650).

AD VENT: The liturgical season
of four weeks devoted to
preparation for the coming o f
Christ at Christmas (524).
ALMSG IVING: Money or goods
given to the poor as an act of
penance or fraternal charity.
Almsgiving, together with prayer
and fasting, are traditionally
recommended to foster the state
of interior penance (1434; cf. 1 969,
2447).
ALTAR: The center and focal
point of a church, where the
sacrifice of Christ on the cross is
made present under sacramental
signs in the Mass. Among the
Israelites the altar was the place
where sacrifices were offered
to God. The Christian altar
represents two aspects of the
mystery of the Eucharist, as the
altar of sacrifice where Christ as
the sacrificial victim offers himself
for our sins and as the table of the
Lord where Christ gives himself
to us as food from heaven (1 1 82,
1383).
AMEN: A Hebrew word meaning
"truly; it is so; let it be done,"
signifying agreement with what
has been said. The prayers of
the New Testament and of the
Church's liturgy, and the Creeds,
conclude with "amen." Jesus used
the word to introduce solemn
assertions, to emphasize their
trustworthiness and authority

(1061, 1 345, 1 396, 2856, 2865).
ANALOGY OF FAITH:
The coherence of the truths of the
faith among themselves and
within the whole plan of
Revelation (1 14).

866
ANAMNESIS: The "remem­
brance" of God's saving deeds
in history in the liturgical action
of the Church, which inspires
thanksgiving and praise ( 1 1 03).
Every Eucharistic Prayer contains
an anamnesis or memorial in
which the Church calls to mind
the Passion, Resurrection, and
glorious return of Christ Jesus
(1 354, 1362).
ANAPHORA: The Eucharistic
Prayer-the prayer of thanks­
giving and consecrationwhich is the heart and summit of
the celebration of the Mass (1352).
ANGEL: A spiritual, personal,
and immortal creature, with intel­
ligence and free will, who glorifies
God without ceasing and who
serves God as a messenger of his
saving plan (329-331 ) . See
Guardian Angels.

ANGER: An emotion which is not
in itself wrong, but which, when it
is not controlled by reason or
hardens into resentment and hate,
becomes one of the seven capital
sins. Christ taught that anger is an
offense against the fifth com­
mandment (1 765, 1866, 2262).

ANNUNCIATI ON: The visit of
the angel Gabriel to the virgin
Mary to inform her that she was
to be the mother of the Savior.
After giving her consent to God's
word, Mary became the mother of
Jesus by the power of the Holy
Spirit (484, 494).
ANOINTING: A symbol of the
Holy Spirit, whose "anointing" of
Jesus as Messiah fulfilled the
prophecies of the Old Testament.
Christ (in Hebrew Messiah) means
the one "anointed" by the Holy
Spirit. Anointing is the sacra­
mental sign of Confirmation,

Glossary
called Chrisma tion in the
Churches of the East. Anointings
form part of the liturgical rites of
the catechumenate, and of the
Sacraments of Baptism and Holy
Orders (695). See Christ.

ANOINTING OF THE SICK:
One of the seven sacraments, also
known as the "sacrament of the
dying," administered by a priest
to a baptized person who begins
to be in danger of death because
of illness or old age, through
prayer and the anointing of the
body with the oil of the sick. The
proper effects of the sacrament
include a special grace of healing
and comfort to the Christian who
is suffering the infirmities of
serious illness or old age, and the
forgiving of the person's sins

(1499, 1520, 1523, 1 526-32).
ANTICHRIST: The "deceitful
one" referred to in the New
Testament, associated with the
"mystery of iniquity" which will
precede the second coming of
Christ, through which people will
be led away from the t ruth to
follow a false "messianism," by
which man glorifies himself and
human achievement in place of
God and his Messiah come in the
flesh, in whom the kingdom will
be fulfilled (675-677).
APOSTASY: The total repu­
diation of the Christian faith
(2089; cf. 817).

APOSTLE: A term meaning one
who is sen t as Jesus was sent by
the Father, and as he sent his
chosen disciples to preach the
Gospel to the whole world. He
called the Twelve to become his
Apostles, chosen witnesses of his
Resurrection and the foundation
on which the Church is built (857).

867

Glossary
The apostolic office is permanent
in the Church, in order to ensure
that the divine mission entrusted
to the Apostles by Jesus will
continue to the end of time. The
bishops receive their office as
successors of the Apostles
through the Sacrament of Holy
Orders (860) . See Apostolic
Succession.

APOSTLES' CREED: A statement
of Christian faith developed from
the baptismal creed or "symbol"
of the ancient Church of Rome,
the see of St. Peter, first of the
Apostles. The Apostles' Creed is
considered to be a faithful
summary of the faith of the
Apostles (194).
APOSTOLATE: The activity of the
Christian which fulfills the apostolic
nature of the whole Church by
working to extend the reign of
Christ to the entire world (863).

APOSTOLIC SUCCESSION:
The hand ing on of apostolic
p reaching and authority from the
Apostles to their successors the
bishops through the laying on of
hands, as a permanent office in
the Church (77, 861 ) .

APPARITION: A n appearance to
people on earth of a heavenly
being-Christ, Mary, an angel, or
a saint. The apparitions of Jesus in
his risen body to his disciples
occu rred between Easter and his
ascension into heaven (641, 659).
ASCENSION: The entry of
Jesus' humanity into divine glory
in God's heavenly domain, forty
days after his Resurrection
(659, 665).
ASCESIS: The practice of
penance, mortification, and
self-denial to promote greater

self-mastery and to foster the way
of perfection by embracing the
way of the cross (2015).

ASSUMPTION: The dogma
which recognizes the Blessed Virgin
Mary's singular participation in her
Son's Resurrection by which she
was taken up body and soul into
heavenly glory, when the course of
her earthly life was finished (966).
ATHEISM: The denial in theory
and /or practice tha t God exists.
Atheism is a sin against the virtue
of religion required by the first
commandment of the law (2124-5).
-

B

-

BAPTISM: The first of the seven
sacraments, and the "door" which
gives access to the other sacra­
ments. Baptism is the first and
chief sacrament of forgiveness of
sins because it unites us with
Christ, who died for our sins and
rose for our justification. Baptism,
Confirmation, and Eucharist
constitute the "sacraments of
initiation" by which a believer
receives the remission of original
and personal sin, begins a new life
in Christ and the Holy Spirit, and
is incorporated into the Church,
the body of Christ. The rite of
Baptism consists in immersing the
candidate in water, or pouring
water on the head, while pro­
nouncing the invocation of the
Most Holy Trinity: the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit (977, 1213
ff.; 1275, 1278).
BEATIFIC VISION:
The contemplation of God in
heavenly glory, a gift of God
which is a constitutive element o f
the happiness (or beatitude) o f
heaven (1 028, 1 720).

Glossa ry

868
B EATITUDE: Happiness or
blessedness, especially the eternal
happiness of heaven, which is
described as the vision of God, or
entering into God's rest by those
whom He makes "partakers of the
divine nature" (1 024, 1 721).

BEATITUDES: The teachings of
Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount
on the meaning and way to true
happiness (cf. Mt 5: 1-12; Lk 6:
20-23). These teachings reflect the
promises made to the chosen
people since Abraham; they
portray the countenance of Christ
and describe his charity. More­
over, by shedding light on the
actions and attitudes charac­
teristic of the Christian life, they
describe the vocation of all the
faithful (1 716).
BIBLE: Sacred Scripture: the
books which contain the truth of
God's revelation and were
composed by human authors
inspired by the Holy Spirit (105).
The Bible contains both the
forty-six books of the Old
Testament and the twenty-seven
books of the New Testament
(120). See Old Testament; New
Testament.
BIBLICAL INSPIRATION: The
gift of the Holy Spirit which
assisted a human author to write
a biblical book so that it has God
as its author and teaches
faithfully, without error, the
saving truth that God has willed
to be consigned to us (105).
BISHOP: One who has received
the fullness of the Sacrament of
Holy Orders, which makes him a
member of the episcopal college
and a successor of the Apostles.
He is the shepherd of a particular

church entrusted to him (1 557; cf.

861, 886).
BLASPHEMY: Speech, thought,
or action involving contempt for
God or the Church, or persons or
things dedicated to God. Blas­
phemy is directly opposed to the
second commandment (2148).
BLESSED SACRAMENT:
A name given to the Holy
Eucharist, especially the con­
secrated elements reserved in the
tabernacle for adoration, or for the
sick (1330).

BLESSING: A blessing or
benediction is a prayer invoking
God's power and care upon some
person, place, thing, or under­
taking. The prayer of benediction
acknowledges God as the source
of all blessing. Some blessings
confer a permanent status: con­
secration of persons to God, or
setting things apart for liturgical
usage (1671, 2626).
BODY OF CHRIST: (1) The
human body which the Son of
God assumed through his
conception in the womb of Mary
and which is now glorified in
heaven (467, 476, 645). (2) This
same body and blood, together
with the soul and divinity, of our
Lord Jesus Christ are
sacramentally present in the
Eucharist under the appearances
of bread and wine (1 374). (3) The
Church is called the (mystical)
Body of Christ because of the
intimate communion which Jesus
shares with his disciples; the
metaphor of a body, whose head
is Christ and whose members are
the faithful, provides an image
which keeps in focus both the
unity and the diversity of the
Church (787, 790, 1396).

CALUMNY: A false statement
which harms the reputation of
others and gives occasion for false
judgments concerning them

(2477).
CANON LAW: The rules (canons
or laws) which provide the norms
for good order in the visible
society of the Church. Those
canon laws that apply universally
are contained in the Codes of
Canon Law. The most recent Code
of Canon Law was promulgated
in 1983 for the Latin (Western)
Church and in 1991 for the
Eastern Church (The Code of

Canons of the Eastern Ch urches).
CANON OF THE MASS: The
central part of the Mass, also
known as the Eucharistic Prayer
or "anaphora," which contains
the prayer of thanksgiving and
consecration (1352).

CANON OF SCRIPTURE:
The Church's complete list of
sacred books of the Bible (120).

CANONIZATION: The solemn
declaration by the Pope that a
deceased member of the faithful
may be proposed as a model and
intercessor to the Christian faith­
ful and venerated as a saint on the
basis of the fact that the person
lived a life of heroic virtue or
remained faithful to God through
martyrdom (828; cf. 957).

CAPITAL SINS: Sins which
engender other sins and vices.
They are traditionally numbered
as seven: pride, covetousness,
envy, anger, gluttony, lust, and
sloth (1 866).
CARDINAL VIRTUES: Four
pivotal human virtues (from the

Latin cardo, "pivot"): prudence,
justice, fortitude, and temperance.
The human virtues are stable
dispositions of the intellect and
will that govern our acts, order
our passions, and guide our
conduct in accordance with
reason and faith (1805, 1 834).

CA TECHESIS: An education of
children, young people, and
adults in the faith of the Church
through the teaching of Christian
doctrine in an organic and
systematic way to make them
disciples of Jesus Christ. Those
who perform the ministry of
catechesis in the Church are called
"catechists" (5, 426-427).
CATECHISM: A popular
summary or compendium of
Ca tholic doctrine about fa ith and
morals and designed for use in
catechesis (11).
CATECHUMEN: A person who
is preparing for Baptism. The
catechumenate is the formation of
these catechumens in preparation
for their Christian Initiation, and
aims at bringing their conversion
and their faith to maturity within
the ecclesial community (1248).
The candidates are anointed with
oil of catechumens by which they
are strengthened in their con­
version from sin and renunciation
of Satan (1237).
CATHEDRAL: The official
church of the bishop of a diocese.
The Greek word cathedra means
chair or throne; the bishop's
"chair" symbolizes his teaching
and governing authority, and is
located in the principal church or
"cathedral" of the local diocese of
which he is the chief pastor
(cf. 1572).

870
CATHOLIC: One of the four
marks or notes of the Church,
taken from the Nicene Creed. The
Chu rch is catholic or universal
both because she possesses the
fullness of Christ's presence and
the means of salvation, and
because she has been sent out by
Christ on a mission to the whole
of the human race (750, 830).
CATHOLIC CHURCH: The
Church established by Christ on
the foundation of the Apostles,
possessing the fullness of the
means of salvation which he has
willed: correct and complete
confession of faith, full sacra­
mental life, and ordained ministry
in apostolic succession (830).
CELIBACY: The state or
condition of those who have
chosen to remain unmarried for
the sake o f the kingdom of heaven
in order to give themselves
entirely to God and to the service
of his people. In the Latin Church,
celibacy is obligatory for bishops
and priests. In some Eastern
Churches, celibacy is a pre­
requisite for the ordination only
of bishops; priests may not marry
after they have been ordained
(1579, 1580).
CHARACTER,
SACRAMENTAL: An indelible
spiritual mark which is the
permanent effect of the Sacra­
ments of Baptism, Confirmation,
and Holy Orders, by which a
person is given a new permanent
configuration to Christ and a
specific standing in the Church;
the reception of these sacraments
is never repeated (1 272, 1304,

1582).
CHARISM: A specific gift or
grace of the Holy Spirit which

Glossary
directly or indirectly benefits the
Church, given in order to help a
person live out the Christian life,
or to serve the common good in
building up the Chu rch (799, 951).

CHARITY: The theological virtue
by which we love God above all
things for his own sake, and our
neighbor as ourselves for the love
of God (1822).
CHASTITY: The moral virtue
which, under the cardinal virtue
of temperance, provides for the
successful integration of sexuality
within the person leading to the
inner unity of the bodily and
spiritual being (2337). Chastity is
called one of the fruits of the Holy
Spirit (1832).
CHOIR: A group of persons
trained to lead in the singing at
l iturgical celebrations ( 1 143).
CHRISM: Perfumed oil, con­
secrated by the bishop, which
signifies the gift of the Holy Spirit.
Chrism is used for consecration in
the Sacraments of Baptism, Con­
firmation, and Holy Orders (1241,
1289, 1291, 1294).
CHRISMATION: The name used
in the Eastern Churches for the
Sacrament of Confirmation, from
the "chrism" or "myron" used in
the anointing (1289).

CHRIST: From the Greek trans­
lation of the Hebrew Messiah,
which means "anointed." It
became the name proper to Jesus
because he accomplished perfectly
the divine mission of priest,
prophet, and King, signified by
his anointing as Messiah, "Christ"
(436) . See Jesus Christ; Messiah;
Anointing.

871

Glossary
CHRISTIAN: A name derived
from that of Christ himself. The
name refers to all those who have
been anointed through the gift of
the Holy Spirit in Baptism; hence,
the followers of Christ, the mem­
bers of the Christian Church.
According to Acts 1 1 :26 "it was in
Antioch that the disciples were
first called Christians" (1289).
CHRISTMAS: The feast of the
Nativity, the birth of Jesus (1 171).
CHURCH: The name given the
"convocation" or "assembly" of
the People God has called
together from "the ends of the
earth." In Christian usage, the
word "Church" has three
inseparable meanings: the People
that God gathers in the whole
world; the particular or local
church (diocese); and the
liturgical (above all Eucharistic)
assembly. The Church draws her
life from the Word and the Body
of Christ, and so herself becomes
Christ's Body (752). In the Creed,
the sole Church of Christ is pro­
fessed to be one, holy, catholic,
and apostolic (81 1 ).

CIRCUMCISION: The rite
prescribed in Judaism and other
cultures which involves cutting
off the foreskin of a male.
Circumcision was a sign of the
covenant between God and his
people Israel and prefigured the
rite of Christian initiation in
Baptism. Jesus was circumcised
eight days after his birth in accord
with Jewish law (527).
COLLEGIALITY: The principle
that all the bishops of the Church
with the Pope at their head form a
single "college," which succeeds
in every generation the "college"
of the Twelve Apostles, with Peter

at their head, which Christ
insti tuted as the foundation of the
Church. This college of bishops
together with, but never without,
the Pope has supreme and fu ll
authority over the universal
Church (861, 880, 883).

COMMANDM ENT: A norm of
moral and/or religious action;
above all, the Ten Commandments
given by God to Moses. Jesus
summarized all the command­
ments in the twofold command of
love of God and love of neighbor
(2052).
COMMANDMENTS OF THE
CHURCH: See Precepts of the
Church.

COMMUNION: Holy Com­
munion, the reception of the Body
and Blood of Christ in the
Eucharist (1 382). More generally,
our fellowship and union with
Jesus and other baptized Chris­
tians in the Church, which has its
source and summit in the cele­
bration of the Eucharist. In this
sense, Church as communion is
the deepest vocation of the
Church (959).
COMMUNION OF SAINTS:
The unity in Christ of all the
redeemed, those on earth and
those who have died. The
communion of saints is professed
in the Apostles' Creed, where it
has also been interpreted to refer
to unity in the "holy things"
(communio sanctorum), especially
the unity of faith and charity
achieved through participation in
the Eucharist (948, 957, 960, 1474).

CONCUPISCENCE: Human
appetites or desires which remain
disordered due to the temporal
consequences of original sin,
which remain even after Baptism,

872
and which produce an inclina tion
to sin (1264, 1426, 2515).

CONFESSION: An essential
element of the Sacrament of
Penance or Reconciliation, which
consists in telling one's sins to the
priestly minister. By extension,
the word confession is used to
refer to the Sacrament of Penance
itself (1455).
CONFIRMATI ON: One of the
ensemble of the Sacraments of
Initiation into the Church,
together with Baptism and
Eucharist. Confirmation com­
pletes the grace of Baptism by a
special outpouring of the gifts of
the Holy Spirit, which seal or
"confirm" the baptized in union
with Christ and equip them for
active participation in the worship
and apostolic life of the Church
(1 285) .
CONSCIENCE: The interior voice
of a human being, within whose
heart the inner law of God is
inscribed. Moral conscience is a
judgment of practical reason
about the moral quality of a
human action. It moves a person
at the appropriate moment to do
good and to avoid evil (1 777-8).
An examination of conscience is
recommended as a preparation
for the reception of the Sacrament
of Penance (1454).
CONSECRATED LIFE:
A permanent state of life
recognized by the Church,
entered freely in response to the
call of Christ to perfection, and
characterized by the profession of
the evangelical counsels of pov­
erty, chastity, and obedience (914).
See Vow .

CONSECRATED VIRGINS:
Women who have decided with

Glossary
'

the Church's approval to cling
only to the Lord and to live in a
state of virginity " for the sake of
the kingdom of heaven" and are
consecrated in that state by a
solemn rite (922-4).

CONS ECRATI ON:
The dedication of a thing or
person to divine service by a
prayer or blessing. The con­
secration at Mass is that part of
the Eucharistic Prayer during
which the Lord's words of insti­
tution of the Eucharist at the Last
Supper are recited by the priestly
minister, making Christ's body
and blood -his sacrifice offered
on the cross once for all-sacra­
mentally present under the
species of bread and wine (1352,

1 353).
CONTEMPLATION: A form of
wordless prayer in which mind
and heart focus on God's great­
ness and goodness in affective,
loving adoration; to look on Jesus
and the mysteries of his life with
faith and love (2628, 2715).
CONTRACEPTION,
ARTIFICIAL: The use of mech­
anical, chemical, or medical
procedures to prevent conception
from taking place as a result of
sexual intercourse; contraception
offends against the openness to
procreation required of marriage
and also the inner truth of con­
jugal love (2370).

CONTRITI ON: Sorrow of the
soul and hatred for the sin
committed, together with a
resolution not to sin again.
Contrition is the most important act of the penitent, and is
necessary for the reception of the
Sacrament of Penance (1451).

873

Glossary
CONVERSION: A radical
reorientation of the whole life
away from sin and evil, and
toward God. This change of heart
or conversion is a central element
of Christ's preaching, of the
Church's ministry of evan­
gelization, and of the Sacrament
of Penance and Reconciliation
(1427, 1431, 1423; cf. 821).

COUNCIL, ECUM ENICAL: A
gathering of all the bishops of the
world, in the exercise of their
collegial authority over the uni­
versal Church. An ecumenical
council is usually called by the
successor of St. Peter, the Pope, or
at least confirmed or accepted by
him (884).
COUNSEL: See Evangelical
Counsels; Gifts of the Holy Spirit.
COVENANT: A solemn agree­
ment between human beings or
between God and a human being
involving mutual commitments or
guarantees. The Bible refers to
God's covenants with Noah,
Abraham, and Moses as leader of
the chosen people, Israel. In the
Old Testament or Covenant, God
revealed his law through Moses
and prepared his people for
salvation through the prophets.
In the New Testament or Cov­
enant, Christ established a new
and eternal covenant through his
own sacrificial death and Resur­
rection. The Christian economy is
the new and definitive Covenant
which will never pass away, and
no new public revelation is to be
expected before the glorious
manifestation of our Lord Jesus
Christ (56, 62, 66). See Old
Testament; New Testament.

COVETOUSNESS: A disordered
inclination or desire for pleasure

or possessions. One of the capital
sins, it is proscribed by the ninth
and tenth commandments (2514,

2534).
CREATION: The act by which the
eternal God gave a beginning to
all that exists outside of himself.
Creation also refers to the created
universe or totality of what exists,
as often expressed by the formula
"the heavens and the earth" (290).
CREED: A brief, normative
summary statement or profession
of Christian faith, e.g., the
Apostles' Creed, the Nicene
Creed. The word "Creed" comes
from the Latin Credo, meaning "I
believe," with which the Creed
begins. Creeds are a lso called
Symbols of Faith (1 87).
CROSS: The i nstrument of
execution on which Christ died; a
symbol of the unique sacrifice of
Christ as sole mediator between
God and man. Jesus invited his
disciples to take up their cross and
follow him, in order to associate
with his redeeming sacrifice
those who were to be its first
beneficiaries. Catholics begin their
prayers and actions with the Sign
of the Cross "in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Spirit. Amen." A devotional
cross with the figure of Jesus
suspended on it is called a
"crucifix" (61 6, 6 1 8, 2166).

DEACON, DIACONATE: A
third degree of the hierarchy of
the Sacrament of Holy Orders,
after bishop and priest. The
deacon is ordained not to
priesthood but for ministry and
service. Deacons are ordained to
assist the bishop and priests in the

Glossa ry

874
celebra tion of the divine mys­
teries, above all the Eucharist, in
the distribution of Holy Com­
munion, in assisting at and
blessing marriages, in the pro­
clamation of the Gospel and
preaching, in presiding over
funerals, and in dedicating
themselves to the various
ministries of charity. While the
Churches of the East have always
had a functioning order of dea­
cons, in the West the permanent
diaconate was reestablished by
the Second Vatican Council (1 569,

1571).
DECALOGUE: The Ten Com­
mandments (literally, "ten
words") given by God to Moses
on Sinai. In order to be faithful
to the teaching of Jesus, the
Decalogue must be interpreted
in the light of the great com­
mandment of love of God and
neighbor (2055, 2056). See
Commandment.
DEFINITION, DOGMATIC:
A solemn declara tion by an
ecumenical council or by the Pope
that a doctrine is revealed by God
and must be believed by the uni­
versal Church; such definitions
are called infallible, and must be
adhered to with the obedience of
faith (891 ).

DEMON: See Devil/Demon.
DEPOSIT OF FAITH: The
heritage of faith contained in
Sacred Scripture and Tradition,
handed on in the Church from the
time of the Apostles, from which
the Magisterium draws all that it
proposes for belief as being
divinely revealed (84; cf. 1202).

DESCENT INTO HELL: An
article in the Apostles' Creed
referring to the victory over death

and sin which Ch(ist won by
being "raised from the dead."
Jesus, like all people, experienced
death and in his soul joined the
others in the realm of the dead,
where he descended as Savior,
proclaiming the Gospel to the
spirits imprisoned there in order
to free the just ones who had gone
before him (632).

DESPAIR: The abandonment of
hope in salvation and the
forgiveness of sins (2091).

DETRACTION: Disclosure of
another's faults and sins, without
an objectively valid reason, to
persons who did not know about
them, thus causing unjust injury
to that person's reputation (2477).
DEVELOPMENT, DOCTRINAL:
Growth in the understanding of
God's revelation, which continues
though the contemplation and
study of believers, theological
research, and the preaching of the
Magisterium (94).

DEVIL/DEMON: A fallen angel,
who sinned against God by
refusing to accept his reign. Satan
or the devil, the Evil One, and the
other demons were at first good
angels, created naturally good,
who became evil by their own
doing (391, 1 707; cf. 2851).
DIACONATE: See Deacon,
Diaconate.

DIOCESE: A "particular church,"
a community of the faithful in
communion of faith and
sacraments whose bishop has
been ordained in apostolic
succession. A diocese is usually a
determined geographic area;
sometimes it may be constituted
as a group of people of the same

875

Glossary
rite or language. In Eastern
churches, an eparchy (833).

DISCIPLE: Those who accepted
Jesus' message to follow him are
called his disciples. Jesus asso­
cia ted his disciples with his own
life, revealed the mystery of the
Kingdom to the discipl es a � d
.
_ m1ss1on,
gave them a share in h1s
his joy, and his sufferings (767,
787) .
DIVINE OFFICE: The Liturgy of
the Hours, the public prayer of
the Church which sanctifies the
whole course of the day and
night. Christ thus continues his
priestly work through the prayer
of his priestly people (1 1 74).
DIVORCE: The claim that the
indissoluble marriage bond
validly entered into between a
man and a woman is broken. A
civil dissolution of the marriage
contract (divorce) does not free
persons from a valid marriage
before God; remarriage would not
be morally licit (2382; cf. 1650).

DOCTRINE/DOGMA: The
revealed teachings of Christ
which are proclaimed by the
fullest extent of the exercise of the
authority of the Church's Magis­
terium. The faithful are obliged to
believe the truths or dogmas
contained in divine Revelation
and defined by the Magisterium
(88).
DOXOLOGY: Christian prayer
which gives praise and glory to
God, often in a special way to the
three divine persons of the
Trinity. Liturgical prayers trad­
itionally conclude with the
doxology "to the Father, through
the Son, in the Holy Spirit"; the
final doxology of the Lord's
Prayer renews the prayer's first

three petitions in the form of
adoration and praise (2639, 2855).

-EEASTER: The greatest and oldest
Christian feast, which celebra tes
Christ's Resurrection from the
dead. Easter is the "feast of
feasts," the solemnity of solemn­
ities, the "Great Sunday." Chris­
tians prepare for it during Lent
and Holy Week, and ca techumens
usually receive the Sacraments of
Christian Initiation (Baptism,
Confirmation, Eucharist) at the
Easter Vigil ( 1 1 69; cf. 647).
EASTERN CHURCH ES:
Churches of the East in union
with Rome (the Western Church),
but not of Roman rite, with their
own liturgical, theological, and
administrative traditions, such as
those of the Byzantine,
Alexandrian or Coptic, Syriac,
Armenian, Maronite, and
Chaldean rites. The variety of
particular churches with dis­
tinctive traditions witnesses to the
catholicity of the one Church of
Christ, which takes root in distinct
cultures (1 202-1203; d. 835).

ECCLESIASTIC/
ECCLESIASTICAL: Pertaining to
or of the Church (Greek/ Latin:
ecclesia). Hence ecclesiastical
government is church govern­
ment (857); an ecclesiastical
province is a grouping of church
jurisdictions or dioceses (�8_7); an
ecclesiastic is a church offlClal.

ECON OMY: The structure and
organization of pr ? ductive ': ork
or activity in a soe1ety, formmg
the basis for financial support and
stability of individuals, families,
and society. The morality of
economic activity is judged

876

according to the seventh com­
mandment; economic activity is
one of the principal points
addressed by the Church's social
doctrine (2426, 2430).

ECONOMY OF SA LVATION
(DIVINE ECONOMY) : From a
Greek word (oikonomia, literally
"management of a household" or
"stewardship") which refers to
God's revelation and com­
munication of himself to the
world in time for the sake of the
salvation of all humanity; hence,
the economy of salvation (258,
1066). The Fathers of the Church
distinguished oikonomia from
theologia; the latter term refers to
the mystery of the internal life of
the Trinity (236). The economy of
salvation, on the other hand,
refers to God's activity in creating
and governing the world, par­
ticularly with regard to his plan
for the salvation of the world in
the person and work of Jesus
Christ, a plan which is being
accomplished through his Body
the Church, in its life and
sacraments; hence, the "sacra­
mental economy" (1076, 1093).

ECUM ENICAL COUNCIL:
See Council, Ecumenical.
ECUM ENISM: Promotion of the
restora tion of unity among all
Christians, the unity which is a
gift of Christ and to which the
Church is called by the Holy
Spirit. For the Catholic Church,
the Decree on Ecumenism of the
Second Vatican Council provides
a charter for ecumenical efforts
(816, 820-22).
ENCYCLICAL: A pastoral letter
written by the Pope and sent to
the whole Church and even to the
whole world, to express Church

Glossa ry
teaching on some important
matter. Encyclicals are expres­
sions of the ordina ry papal
magisterium (cf. 892) .

ENVY: Resentment or sadness at
another's good fortune, and the
desire to have it for oneself. One
of the seven capital sins, envy is
contrary to the tenth com­
mandment (2539).
EP ARCHY: See Diocese.
EPICLESIS: The prayer peti­
tioning God to send the Holy
Spirit so that the offerings at the
Eucharist may become the body
and blood of Christ and thus the
faithful, by receiving them, may
themselves become a living offer­
ing to God. In every sacrament,
the prayer asking for the sancti­
fying power of God's Holy Spirit
is an " epiclesis" ( 1 1 05, 1 1 27).
EPIPHANY: The feast which
celebrates the manifestation to the
world of the newborn Christ as
Messiah, Son of God, and Savior
of the world. The feast o f Epi­
phany celebrates the adoration of
Jesus by the wise men (magi) from
the east, together with his baptism
in the Jordan and the wedding
feast of Cana in Galilee (528; cf.
535) .
EPISCOPAL/EPISCOPATE:
Pertaining to the office of bishop
(Greek: episkopos), hence episcopal
consecration, the episcopal
college, episcopal conferences
{883, 887, 1557). "Episcopate" is a
collective noun referring to all
those who have received sacra­
mental ordination as bishops.

EREMITICAL LIFE: The life of a
hermit, separate from the world in
praise of God and for the sal­
vation of the world, in the silence

877

Glossary
of solitude, assiduous prayer, and
penance (920).

ES CHATOLOGY: From the
Greek word eschaton, meaning
"last." Eschatology refers to the
area of Christian faith which is
concerned about "the last things,"
and the coming of Jesus on "the
last day": our human destiny,
death, judgment, resurrection of
the body, heaven, purgatory, and
hell-all of which are contained in
the final articles of the Creed
(1001, 1020-1050; cf. 2771 ).
ETERNAL LIFE: Living forever
with God in the happiness of
heaven, entered after death by the
souls of those who die in the grace
and friendship of God (988, 1020).
In preaching the kingdom of
heaven, Jesus called all people to
eternal life, which is anticipated in
the grace of union with Christ:
"This is eternal life, that they may
know you, the only true God, and
Jesus Christ whom you have sent"

(]n 1 7:3).
EUCHARIST: The ritual, sacra­
mental action of thanksgiving to
God which constitutes the prin­
cipal Christian liturgical cele­
bration of and communion in the
paschal mystery of Christ. The
liturgical action called the Euch­
arist is also traditionally known as
the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. It is
one of the seven sacraments of the
Church; the Holy Eucharist com­
pletes Christian initiation (1 322
ff.). The Sunday celebration of the
Eucharist is at the heart of the
Church's life (2177). See Mass.
EUCHARISTIC PRAYER:
See Canon of the Mass.
EUTHANASIA: A n action or an
omission which, of i tself or by
intention, causes the death of

handicapped, sick, or dying
persons-sometimes with an
attempt to justify the act as a
means of eliminating su ffering.
Eu thanasia violates the fifth
commandment of the law of God

(2277).
EVANGELICAL COUNSELS:
In general, the teachings of the
New Law proposed by Jesus to
his disciples which lead to the
perfection of Christian life. In the
New Law, the precepts are inten­
ded to remove whatever is incom­
patible with charity; the evan­
gelical counsels are to remove
whatever might hinder the
development of charity, even if
not contrary to it (1 973). The
public profession of the evan­
gelical counsels of poverty,
chastity, and obedience is a
constitutive element of state o f
consecrated life i n t h e Church

(915).
EVANGELIST: One of the four
authors to whom is ascribed the
writing of the Gospels, i.e.,
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John
(125, 120). The term is also used
for one who works actively to
spread and promote the Christian
faith.

EVANGELIZATION:
The proclamation of Christ and
his Gospel (Greek: evangelion) by
word and the testimony of life, in
fulfillment of Christ's command
(905; cf. 861).

EVE: According to t h e creation
story in Genesis, the first woman;
wife of Adam. God did not create
man a solitary being; from the
beginning, "male and female he
created them" (Gen 1 :29) (369,
375). Because she is the mother of
the eternal Son of God made man,

878
Jesus Christ the "new Adam,"
Mary is called the "new Eve," the
"mother of the living" in the order
of grace (51 1 ) . See Adam.

EVIL: The opposite or absence of
good. One form of evil, physical
evil, is a result of the "state of
journeying" toward its ultimate
perfection in which God created
the world, involving the existence
of the less perfect a longside the
more perfect, the constructive and
the destructive forces of nature,
the appearance and disappear­
ance of certain beings (310). Moral
evil, however, results from the
free choice to sin which angels
and men have; it is permitted by
God, who knows how to derive
good from it, in order to respect
the freedom of his creatures (3 1 1 ).
The entire revelation of God's
goodness in Christ is a response to
the existence of evil (309, 385,
1 707). The devil is called the Evil
One. See Devil /Demon .
EXAMINATION OF
CONSCIENCE: Prayerful self­
reflection on our words and deeds
in the light of the Gospel to deter­
mine how we may have sinned
aga inst God. The reception of the
Sacrament of Penance ought to be
prepared for by such an exam­
ination of conscience (1454).

EXCOMMUNICATION:
A severe ecclesiastical penalty,
resu lting from grave crimes
against the Catholic religion,
imposed by ecclesiastical author­
ity or incurred as a direct result of
the commission of an offense.
Excommunication excludes the
offender from taking part in the
Eucharist or other sacraments and
from the exercise of any ecclesi­
astical office, ministry, or function

(1463).

Glossary
EXODUS: God's saving inter­
vention in history by which he
libera ted the Hebrew people from
slavery in Egypt, made a covenant
with them, and brought them into
the Promised Land. The Book of
Exodus, the second of the Old
Testament, narrates this saving
history (62). The exodus is com­
memorated by the Jewish people
at Passover, which for Christians
is a foreshadowing of the "pas­
sover" of Jesus Christ from death
to life and is celebrated in the
memorial of the Eucharist (1363).
EXORCISM: The public and
authoritative act of the Church to
protect or liberate a person or
object from the power of the devil
(e.g., demonic possession) in the
name of Christ (1673). A simple
exorcism prayer in preparation for
Baptism invokes God's help in
overcoming the power of Satan
and the spirit of evil (1 237) .
EXPIATION: The act of redemp­
tion and atonement for sin which
Christ won for us by the pouring
out of his blood on the cross, by
his obedient love "even to the
end" (]n 13:1) (433, 616, 1475). The
expiation of sins continues in the
mystical body of Christ and the
communion of saints by joining
our human acts of atonement to
the redemptive action of Christ,
both in this life and in Purgatory.

FAITH: Both a gift of God and a
human act by which the believer
gives personal adherence to God
who invites his response, and
freely assents to the whole truth
that God has revealed. It is this

879

Glossary
revelation of God which the
Church proposes for our belief,
and which we profess in the
Creed, celebrate in the sacra­
ments, live by right conduct that
fulfills the twofold commandment
of charity (as specified in the ten
commandments), and respond to
in our prayer of faith. Faith is both
a theological virtue given by God
as grace, and an obligation which
flows from the first command­
ment of God (26, 142, 150, 1814,

2087).
FAITHFUL, THE CHRISTIAN:
Those who have been incor­
porated into Christ in Baptism
and constituted as the people of
God, the Church (871). The term
"lay faithful" refers to the laity, all
the faithful except those in Holy
Orders and those who belong to a
religious state approved by the
Church (897).

FALL: (1) Biblical revelation about
the reality of sin in human his­
tory. The Biblical story begins
with the original sin freely com­
mitted by the first human beings.
This primeval event is narrated in
figurative language in the Book of
Genesis, which describes this sin
as a "fall" from God's friendship
and grace, which they had
received from God not only for
themselves but for the whole
human race (388, 390). (2) In the
"fall" of angels, Scripture and
Church tradition see the emer­
gence of Satan and the "devil";
the "fall" of these angelic spirits
was due to their freely chosen
rejection of God and His reign

(391-392).
FASTING: Refraining from food
and drink as an expression of
interior penance, in imitation of
the fast of Jesus for forty days in

the desert. Fasting is an ascetical
practice recommended in Scrip­
ture and the writings of the
Church Fathers; it is sometimes
prescribed by a precept of the
Church, especially during the
liturgical season of Lent (538,

1434, 2043).
FATH ER, GOD, THE: God, the
first person of the Blessed Trinity.
Jesus revealed that God is Father
in a unique way: not only as Crea­
tor, the origin of all things, but
also as eternal Father in his rela­
tionship to his only Son, who is
eternally begotten of the Father
and consubstantial with the
Father (240, 242).
FATHERS OF THE CHURCH:
Church teachers and writers of
the early centuries whose teach­
ings are a witness to the Tradition
of the Church (78, 688) .

FEAR OF TH E LORD: One of the
seven gifts of the Holy Spirit
which ensures our awe and
reverence before God (1831).

FEAST DAYS: The annual cycle
of liturgical celebrations com­
memorating the saving mysteries
of Christ's life, as a participation
in the Paschal Mystery, which is
celebrated annually at Easter, the
"Feast of feasts." Feast days
commemorating Mary, the
Mother of God, and the saints are
also celebrated, providing the
faithful with examples of those
who have been glorified with
Christ ( 1 1 69, 1 1 73).
FILIOQUE: A word meaning
"and (from) the Son," added to
the Latin version of the Niceno­
Constantinopolitan Creed, by
which the Latin tradition of the
Creed confesses that the Holy

Glossa ry

Spirit "proceeds from the Father

GENUFLECTI ON: A reverence

made by bending the knee, espe­
cially to express adoration of the
Blessed Sacrament (1 378).

FORN ICATI ON: Sexual inter­
course between an unmarried
man and an unma rried woman.
Fornication is a serious violation
of the sixth commandment of God

(2353).
FORTITUDE: One of the four
cardinal moral virtues which
ensures firmness in difficulties
and constancy in doing the good
(1 808). Fortitude (sometimes
called strength, courage, or might)
is also one of the seven gifts of the
Holy Spirit (1299; cf. 712).
FRUITS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT:
The perfections that the Holy
Spirit forms in us as the " first
fruits" of eternal glory. The trad­
ition of the Church identifies
twelve fruits of the Holy Spirit

(1832).

G ENERAL CONFESSION AND
ABSOLUTION: A communal
form of the Sacrament of Penance
in which, in a case of grave neces­
sity, a priest may give absolution
to all persons present at one time,
after they have made a general,
but not individual, confession of
their sins. For the absolution to be
valid, the faithful must have the
intention of individually confes­
sing their sins in their next indiv­
idual reception of the Sacrament
of Penance (1483).

GENESIS: The first book of Bible,
which describes God's creation of
the world and humanity, and the
drama of sin and the hope for
salvation (120; cf. 289, 337, 355).

GIFTS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT:
Permanent dispositions that make
us docile to follow the promptings
of the Holy Spirit. The traditional
list of seven gifts of the Spirit is
derived from Isaiah 1 1 :1-3: wis­
dom, understanding, knowledge,
counsel, piety, fortitude, and fear
of the Lord (1 830).

GLUTTONY: Overindulgence in
food or drink. Gluttony is one of
the seven capital sins (1 866).
GOD: The infinite divine being,
one in being yet three Persons:
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God
has revealed himself as the "One
who is," as truth and love, as crea­
tor of all tha t is, as the dUthor of
divine revelation, and as the
source of salvation (1 98, 279).
GODPARENT: The sponsor of
one who is baptized, who
assumes a responsibility to assist
the newly-baptized-child or
adult-on the road of Christian
life (1255).
GOSPEL: The "good news" of
God's mercy and love revealed in
the life, death, and resurrection of
Christ. It is this Gospel o r good
news that the Apostles, and the
Church following them, are to
proclaim to the entire world (571,
1946). The Gospel is handed on in
the apostolic tradition of the
Church as the source of all-saving
truth and moral discipline (75).
The four Gospels are the books
written by the evangelists Mat­
thew, Mark, Luke, and John
which have for their central object
Jesus Christ, God's incarnate Son:
his life, teachings, Passion and

881

Glossa ry
glorification, and his Church's
beginnings under the Spirit's
guidance (124, 514).

GOSPEL, LAW OF THE: The
New Law, prepared for by the
Old Law in the time of the Old
Covenant, is the perfection here
on earth of the divine law, natural
and revealed. It is the work of
Christ, expressed particularly in
the Sermon on the Mount, and of
the Holy Spirit, by whose grace it
becomes for us the interior law of
charity (1965).
GRACE: The free and undeserved
gift that God gives us to respond
to our vocation to become his
adopted children. As sanctifying
grace, God shares his divine life
and friendship with us in a habi­
tual gift, a stable and super­
natural disposition that enables
the soul to live with God, to act by
his love. As actual grace, God
gives us the help to conform our
lives to his will. Sacramental grace
and special graces (charisms, the
grace of one's state of life) are gifts
of the Holy Spirit to help us live
out our Christian vocation (1996,
2000; cf. 654).
GUARDIAN ANGELS: Angels
assigned to protect and intercede
for each person (336). See Angel .

-H HAIL MARY: The prayer known
in Latin as the Ave Maria. The first
part of the prayer praises God for
the gifts he gave to Mary as
Mother of the Redeemer; the
second part seeks her maternal
intercession for the members of
the Body of Christ, the Church, of
which she is the Mother (2676).

HAPPINESS: Joy and beatitude
over receiving the fulfillment of
our vocation as creatures: a
sharing in the divine nature and
the vision of God. God put us into
the world to know, love, and
serve him, and so come to the
happiness of paradise (1720).

HEAVEN: Eternal life with God;
communion of life and love with
the Trinity and all the blessed .
Heaven is the state of supreme
and definitive happiness, the goal
of the deepest longings of human­
ity (1023).
HELL: The state of definitive
self-exclusion from communion
with God and the blessed,
reserved for those who refuse by
their own free choice to believe
and be converted from sin, even
to the end of their lives (1 033) .
HERESY: The obstinate denial
after Baptism of a truth which
must be believed with divine and
Catholic faith (2089; cf. 465).
HERMIT: One who l ives the
eremitical life. Through silence
and solitude, in prayer and
penance, the hermit or anchorite
vows, although not necessarily
publicly, to follow the evangelical
counsels out of love for God and
desire for the salvation of the
world (920).
HI ERARCHY: The Apostles and
their successors, the college of
bishops, to whom Christ gave the
authority to teach, sanctify, and
rule the Church i n his name (873).
HIERARCHY OF TRUTHS: The
order (hierarchy) of the truths in
Catholic doctrine, insofar as they
vary in their relation to the central
mystery and foundation o f

Holy Trinity (90, 234).

to accept them as the Word of
God (132, 1 1 00, 1 349).

HOLY DAYS OF OBLIGATION:

HOMOSEXUALITY: Sexual
attraction or orientation toward
persons of the same sex and / or
sexual acts between persons of the
same sex. Homosexual acts are
morally wrong because they
violate God's purpose for human
sexual activity (2357).

Principal feast days on which, in
addition to Sundays, Ca tholics are
obliged by Church law to par­
ticipate in the Eucharist; a precept
of the Church (2043, 21 80).

HOLY ORDERS: See Orders, Holy
HOLY SEE: The seat of the central
administration of the worldwide
Catholic Church; the name is
taken from the seat or diocese of
the Pope, Bishop of Rome and
successor of St. Peter as Vicar of
Christ and pastor of the universal
Church (cf. 882).
HOLY SPI RIT: The third divine
person of the Blessed Trinity, the
personal love of Father and Son
for each other. Also called the
Paraclete (Advocate) and Spirit of
Truth, the Holy Spirit is at work
with the Father and the Son from
the beginning to the completion of
the divine plan for our salvation
(685; cf. 152, 243).
HOLY WATER: Blessed water, a
sacramental whose sprinkling or
use is a reminder of Baptism and
a means of sanctification (1668).
HOLY WEEK: The week pre­
ceding Easter, beginning with
Palm (Passion) Sunday, called the
"Great Week" in the liturgies of
the Eastern Churches. It marks the
Church's annual celebra tion of the
events of Christ's passion, death,
and resurrection, culminating in
the Paschal Mystery ( 1 1 69).
HOMILY: Preaching by an
ordained minister to explain the
Scriptures proclaimed in the
liturgy and to exhort the people

HOPE: The theological virtue by
which we desire and expect from
God both eternal life and the
grace we need to attain it (1817) .

HUMILITY: The virtue b y which
a Christian acknowledges that
God is the author of all good.
Humility avoids inordinate
ambition or pride, and provides
the foundation for turning to God
in prayer (2559). Voluntary
humility can be described as
"poverty of spirit" (2546).
HYMN: Sacred poetry set to
music and meant to raise the
hearts of Christian people to
God, especially during liturgical
services (1 156 ) .
HYPOSTATIC UNION: The
union of the divine and human
natures in the one divine person
(Greek: hypostasis) of the Son of
God, Jesus Christ (252, 468).

ICON: Religious painting trad­
itional among many Eastern
Christians. Christian iconography
expresses in images the same
Gospel message that Scripture
communicates by words ( 1 1 60).
ICONOCLASM: A heresy which
maintained tha t venera tion of
religious images is unlawful.
Iconoclasm was condemned as

Glossa ry
unfaithful to Christian tradition at
the Second Ecumenical Council of
Nicaea in 787 A.D. (2131).

IDOLATRY: The divinization of a
creature in place of God; the sub­
stitution of some one (or thing) for
God; worshiping a creature (even
money, pleasure, or power)
instead of the Creator (21 1 2) .
IMMACULATE CONCEPTION:
The dogma proclaimed in Chris­
tian Tradition and defined in
1 854, that from the first moment
of her conception, Mary-by the
singular grace of God and by
virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ
-was preserved immune from
original sin (491 ).

IMMORTALITY: The quality of
the spiritual human soul whereby
it survives the death of the body
and remains in existence without
end, to be reunited with the body
at the final resurrection (366).
IMPEDIMENT: An obstacle that
makes a person ineligible for per­
forming an act or receiving a
sacrament, e.g., Holy Orders or
Matrimony (cf. 1 635).
INCARNATION: The fact that
the Son of God assumed human
nature and became man in order
to accomplish our salvation in
that same human nature. Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, the second
Person of the Trinity, is both t rue
God and true man, not part God
and part man (461, 464).

INCREDULITY: The willful
refusal to assent to revealed truth,
or even the neglect of this truth

(2089).
INDULG ENCE: The remission
before God of the temporal
punishment due to sin whose

883
guilt has already been forgiven. A
properly disposed member of the
Christian faithful can obtain an
indulgence under prescribed
conditions through the help of the
Church which, as the minister of
redemption, dispenses and
applies with authority the
treasury of the satisfactions of
Christ and the saints. An indul­
gence is partial if it removes part
of the temporal punishment due
to sin, or plenary if it removes all
punishment (1471).

INERRANCY: The a ttribute of
the books of Scripture whereby
they faithfully and without error
teach that truth which God, for
the sake of our salvation, wished
to have confided through the
Sacred Scriptures ( 107).
INFALLIBILITY: The gift of the
Holy Spirit to the Church where­
by the pastors of the Church, the
pope and bishops in union with
him, can definitively proclaim a
doctrine of fai th or morals for the
belief of the faithful (891). This
gift is related to the inability of the
whole body of the faithful to err
in matters of faith and morals

(92).
I NITIATION, CHRISTIAN: The
foundations of every Christian life
laid by the Sacraments of Baptism,
Confirmation, and Eucharist. The
process by which a non-baptized
person is prepared to become a
full member of the Church is
called the catechumenate, which
was restored in the Latin Church
by the Second Vatican Council,
and whose distinct stages and
rites are found in the Rite of Chris­

tian Initiation of Adults (1212,
1 230).

profession of the evangelical
counsels of poverty, chastity, and
obedience (925) . See Consecrated
Life.

IN STITUTE, SECULAR:
A form of consecrated life in
which the Christian faithful living
in the world strive for the per­

INTERCESSION: A form of
prayer of petition on behalf of
others. The prayer of intercession
leads us to pray as Christ, our
unique Intercessor, prayed (2634).

INTERCOMMUNION:
Participation or sharing in the
reception of the Eucharist or holy
Communion by Christians who
are not fully united to or in ful l
communion with the Catholic
Church (1 398).

IRRELIGION: A vice contrary
by defect to the virtue of religion.
Irreligion directs us away from
rendering to God what we as
creatures owe him in justice (2095,

ISRAEL: The Jewish people,
chosen by God to be his people
and named after Israel Oacob),
from whose twelve sons the tribes
of Israel descend. God formed
Israel into his priestly people in
their exodus from the slavery of
Egypt, when he made the first or

-JJESUS CHRIST: The eternal Son
of God, who was born of the
Virgin Mary, suffered crucifixion
and death, rose from the dead and
ascended into heaven, and will
come again in glory to judge the
living and the dead. "Jesus,"
which means "God saves" in
Hebrew, was the name given to
him at the Annunciation; "Christ"
is a title which comes from the
Greek translation of the Hebrew
Messiah and means "anointed"
(184 f.; 430, 436; cf. 727).

JOHN THE BAPTIST:
The immediate precursor or
herald of Jesus. John identified
Jesus as the Messianic Lamb of
God and baptized him in the
Jordan River. With prophetic
power, John gave witness to Jesus
by his preaching, by the baptism
of conversion he announced, and
finally by his martyrdom (523,

720).
JUDGMENT: The eternal
retribution received by each soul
at the moment of death, i n
accordance with that person's
faith and works ("the particular
judgment") (1021-2). The "Last
Judgment" is God's triumph over
the revolt of evil, after the final
cosmic upheaval of this passing
world. Preceded by the resur­
rection of the dead, it will coincide
with the second coming of Christ
in glory at the end of time,
disclose good and evil, and reveal
the meaning of salvation history
and the providence of God by
which justice has triumphed over
evil (677-9, 1021, 1038).

885

Glossary
JUDGMENT, RASH: A fault
against the eighth commandment
committed by one who assumes
the moral fault of the neighbor to
be true without sufficient
foundation (2477).

JUSTICE: The cardina l moral
virtue which consists in the con­
stant and firm will to give their
due to God and to neighbor
(1 807). Original justice refers to the
state of holiness in which God
created our first parents (375).
Commutative justice, which obliges
respect for the rights of the o ther,
is required by the seventh com­
mandment; it is distinguished
from legal justice, which concerns
what the citizen owes to the com­
munity, and distributive justice,
which regulates what the com­
munity owes its citizens in pro­
portion to their contribu tions and
needs (24 1 1 } . See Social Justice.

JUSTIFICATION: The gracious
action of God which frees us from
sin and communicates "the
righteousness of God through
faith in Jesus Christ" (Rom 3:22).
Justification is not only the
remission of sins, but also the
sanctification and renewal of the
interior man (1 987-9).

-KKINGDOM OF GOD
(OF HEAVEN):
The reign or rule of God:
"the kingdom of God is . . .
righteousness and peace and joy
in the Holy Spirit" (Rom 14:17).
The kingdom of God draws near
in the coming of the Incarnate
Word; it is announced in the
Gospel; it is the messianic King­
dom, present in the person of
Jesus, the Messiah; it remains in
our midst in the Eucharist. Christ

gave to his Apostles the work of
proclaiming the kingdom, and
through the Holy Spirit forms his
people into a priestly kingdom,
the Church, in which the kingdom
of God is mysteriously present,
for she is the seed and beginning
of the Kingdom on earth. In the
Lord's Prayer ("Thy Kingdom
come") we pray for its final glori­
ous appearance, when Christ will
hand over the kingdom to his
Father (541-554, 709, 763, 2816,

28 19).
-L-

LAITY: The faithful who, having
been incorporated into Christ
through Baptism, are made part
of the people of God, the Church.
The laity participate in their own
way in the priestly, prophetic, and
kingly functions of Christ. Laity
are distinguished from clergy
(who have received Holy Orders)
and those in consecrated life (897).
LAST JUDGM ENT:
See Judgment.
LAST SUPPER: The last meal, a
Passover supper, which Jesus ate
with his disciples the night before
he died. Jesus' passing over to
his father by his death and Resur­
rection, the new Passover, is anti­
cipated in the Last Supper and
celebrated in the Eucharist, which
fulfills the Jewish Passover and
anticipates the final Passover of
the Church in the glory of the
kingdom. Hence the Eucharist is
called "the Lord's Supper"
(61 0- 1 1 , 1329, 1340).
LATIN RITE: The traditions of
liturgy, laws, and practice in the
Church in the West, as distinct
from the rites and practices of the
churches of the East (1 203).

886
LAW, MORAL: A rule of con­
duct established by competent
au thority for the common good.
In biblical terms, the mora/ law is
the fa therly instruction of God,
setting forth the ways which lead
to happiness and proscribing
those which lead to evil. The
divine or eternal law can be either
natural or revealed (positive).
Natural moral law is inscribed in
the heart, and known by human
reason. Revealed law is found in
the ancien t law (Old Testament),
notably the ten commandments,
and in the new law (Law of the
Gospel), the teaching of Christ,
notably the Sermon on the Mount,
which perfects the ancient law

(1950-1 974).
LECTIONARY/LECTOR:
The official, liturgical book
(lectionary) from which the reader
(lector) proclaims the Scripture
readings used in the Liturgy of
the Word ( 1 1 54).

LENT: The liturgical season of
forty days which begins with Ash
Wednesday and ends with the
celebra tion of the Paschal mystery
(Easter Triduum). Lent is the pri­
mary penitential season in the
Church's liturgical year, reflecting
the forty days Jesus spent in the
desert in fasting and prayer (540,

1 095, 1438).
LIFE: Both God's gift of created
human life and His divine life
given to us as sanctifying grace.
Beyond its ordinary meaning of
human life, Jesus used "life" to
signify a share in his own divine
Trinitarian existence, which
becomes possible for those who
respond to his invitation to turn
away from sin and open their
hearts to God's abiding love.
Etemal life signifies that this gift

Glossary
will last forever in the blessedness
of heaven. This gift of God begins
with the "life" of fa ith and "new
life" of Baptism (1 225), is com­
municated in sanctifying grace
(1997), and reaches perfection in
the communion of life and love
with the Holy Trinity in heaven

(1023).
LITURGICAL YEAR: The cele­
bration throughout the year of the
mysteries of the Lord's birth, life,
death, and Resurrection in such a
way that the entire year becomes
a "year of the Lord's grace." Thus
the cycle of the liturgical year and
the great feasts constitute the
basic rhythm of the Christian's life
of prayer, with its focal point at
Easter (1168).
LITURGY: In its original mean­
ing, a "public work" or service
done in the name of or on behalf
of the people. Through the liturgy
Christ our high Priest continues
the work of our redemption
through the Church's celebration
of the Pascha l mystery by which
he accomplished our salvation

(1067-9).
LORD: The Old Testament title
for God that in speaking or read­
ing aloud was always substituted
for the name that was revealed to
Moses and that was too holy to be
pronounced: Yahweh. The New
Testament uses this title both of
God the Father and-in a new
way--of Jesus, the incarnate
Word (209, 446).
LORD'S PRAYER: The title early
Christians gave to the prayer
which Jesus entrusted to his
disciples and to the Church (Mt
6:9-13). This fundamental Chris­
tian prayer is also called the "Our

MARY: The mother of Jesus.

Because she is the mother of Jesus
-Son of God and second Person
of the Blessed Trinity-according
to the flesh, she is rightly called
the Mother of God (Theotokos)
(148, 495). Mary is also called "full
of grace," and "Mother of the
Church," and in Christian prayer
and devotion, "Our Lady," the
"Blessed Virgin Mary," and the
"New Eve" (722, 726, 963). See
Virgin Mary.

LOVE: See Charity.

MAGI: The wise men who came
from the East to pay homage to
the newborn Savior (528).
MAGISTERIUM: The living,
teaching office of the Church,
whose task it is to give as
authentic interpretation of the
word of God, whether in its
written form (Sacred Scripture),
or in the form of Tradition. The
Magisterium ensures the Church's
fidelity to the teaching of the
Apostles in matters of faith and
morals (85, 890, 2033).
MARKS (NOTES) OF THE
CHURCH: The four attributes
(marks or notes) of the Church
mentioned in the Nicene­
Constantinopolitan creed: "We
believe in one, holy, catholic,
and apostolic Church" (81 1 ) .

MARRIAGE: A covenant or
partnership of life between a man
and woman, which is ordered to
the well-being of the spouses and
to the procreation and upbringing
of children. When validly con­
tracted between two baptized
people, marriage is a sacrament
(Matrimony) (1601 ).
MARTYR: A witness to the truth
of the faith, in which the martyr
endures even death to be faithful
to Christ. Those who die for the
faith before having received
Baptism are said to have received
a "baptism of blood," by which
their sins are forgiven and they
share in the death and resur­
rection of Christ (1258, 2473).

MASS: The Eucharist or principal
sacramental celebration of the
Church, established by Jesus at
the Last Supper, in which the
mystery of our salvation through
participation in the sacrificial
death and glorious resurrection of
Christ is renewed and accom­
plished. The Mass renews the
paschal sacrifice of Christ as the
sacrifice offered by the Church. It
is called "Mass" (from the Latin
missa) because of the "mission" or
"sending" with which the litur­
gical celebration concludes (Latin:
"lte, Missa est.") (1 332; cf. 1088,
1382, 21 92). See Eucharist; Paschal
Mystery /Sacrifice.
MATRIMONY: See Marriage.
MEDIATOR/MEDIATRIX:
One who links or reconciles
separate or opposing parties.
Thus Jesus Christ is the "one
mediator between God and the
human race" (1 Tm 2:5). Through
his sacrificial offering he has
become high priest and unique
mediator who has gained for us
access to God's saving grace for
humanity. Moreover, Mary too is
sometimes called Mediatrix in
virtue of her cooperation in the
saving mission of Christ, who
alone is the unique mediator

signs of the presence of God's
kingdom (547) .

MEDITATION: An exercise and
a form of prayer in which we try
to understand God's revelation of
the truths o f faith and the purpose
of the Christian life, and how it
should be l ived, in order to a dhere
and respond to what the Lord is
asking (2705).

MISSION: (1) Trinitarian
missions: To accomplish the divine

MERCY: The loving kindness,
compassion, or forbearance
shown to one who offends (e.g.,
the mercy of God to us sinners)
(1422, 1 829). See Works of Mercy.

MERIT: The reward which God
promises and gives to those who
love him and by his grace perform
good works. One cannot "merit"
justification or eternal life, which
are the free gift of God; the source
of any merit we have before God
is due to the grace of Christ in us

(2006).
MESSIAH: A Hebrew word
meaning "anointed" (436). See
Christ; Jesus Christ.
MINI STRY: The service or work
of sanctification performed by the
preaching of the word and the
celebration of the sacraments by
those in Holy Orders (893, 1 536),
or in determined circumstances,
by laity (903). The New Testament
speaks of a variety of ministries in
the Church; Christ himself is the
source of ministry in the Church
(873-4). Bishops, priests, and
deacons are ordained ministers in
the Church (1548).

MIRACLE: A sign or wonder,
such as a healing or the control of
nature, which can only be
attributed to divine power. The
miracles of Jesus were messianic

plan of the triune God for the
redemption of humanity, the Son
and the Holy Spirit were "sent"
into the world: hence the
Trinitarian "missions" (Latin
missus means "sent") (257, 689).
(2) Apostolic mission: Just as he was
sent by the Father, Jesus sent his
Apostles into the world to
continue his own saving mission
(858). (3) Ch urch as m ission: Thus
the Church is missionary by its
very nature, continuing the
mission or work of Christ through
the Holy Spirit, according to the
plan of God. This apostolic
mission of the Church is fulfilled
according to their different states
of life by the clergy, laity, and
religious (849, 863, 913). Mis­
sionary activity is sometimes
given in a more specific sense as
the work of initial evangelization
and establishment of the Church
in non-Christian lands.

MONASTI C LIFE: Consecrated
life marked by the public pro­
fession of religious vows of
poverty, chastity, and obedience,
and by a stable community life (in
a monastery) with the celebration
of the Liturgy of the Hours in
choir (cf. 927).
MORALITY: Referring to the
goodness or evil of human acts.
Human freedom makes a person a
"moral subject" or agent, able to
judge the morality (goodness or
evil) of the acts which are chosen.
The morality of human acts
depends on the object (or nature)
of the action, the intention or end
foreseen, and the circumstances of
the action ( 1 749; cf. 407).

889

Glossary
MORTAL SIN: A grave infraction
of the law of God that destroys
the divine life in the soul of the
sinner (sanctifying grace), con­
stituting a turn away from God.
For a sin to be mortal, three con­
ditions must be present: grave
matter, full knowledge of the evil
of the act, and full consent of the
will (1 855, 1857).
MOSES: The leader chosen by
God to lead the Israelites out of
their exile in Egypt. To him God
revealed the divine name
(Yahweh) and the law on Mount
Sinai (including the Decalogue),
by which he sealed the covenant
with his people Israel (62, 204). As
lawgiver, Moses was a type of
Christ, the lawgiver of the New
Law.
MYSTAG OGY: A liturgical
catechesis which aims to initiate
people into the mystery of Christ.
In a more specific sense, the
catechetical period following
immediately after the reception of
Baptism by adults (1075).

NATURE: The created order

(341). Human nature, though
wounded and weakened by the
effects of original sin, continues to
participate in the goodness of
God's creative work (405).
Through the Incarnation the
second Person of the Trinity
assumed our human nature,
taking flesh in the womb of the
Virgin Mary (456). The divine
nature refers to the one divine
substance or essence; each of the
three distinct Persons of the Trin­
ity is entirely God, who is one by
the divine nature (253).

NEW COVENANT: The new
"dispensa tion," order or Cov­
enant, established by God in Jesus
Christ, to succeed and perfect the
Old Covenant (cf. 612, 839). The
New Law or Law of the Gospel is
the perfection here on earth of the
divine law, natural and revealed;
this law of the New Covenant is
called a law of love, grace, and
freedom (1 965-72). See Covenant;
Gospel, Law of the.

NEW TESTAMENT:
The twenty-seven books of the
Bible written by the sacred
au thors in apostolic times, which
have Jesus Christ, the incarnate
Son of God -his life, teachings,
passion and glorification, and the
beginnings of his Church-as
their central theme. The promises
and mighty deeds of God in the
old alliance or covenant, reported
in the Old Testament, prefigure
and are fulfilled in the New
Covenant established by Jesus
Christ, reported in the sacred
writings of the New Testament
(124, 128). See Bible; Covenant.

NICENE CREED: The profession
of faith, common to the churches
of East and West, which came
from the first two ecumenical
councils (Nicaea and Constan­
tinople: 325 and 381 A.D.) (1 95-6).
See Creed.
NUPTIAL BLESSING: Prayers
for the blessing of a couple being
married, especially of the bride

(1 624).
-0OBEDIENCE: (1) The submission
to the authority of God which
requires everyone to obey the
divine law. Obedience to the
Church is required in those things

890
which pertain to our salvation;
and obedience is due to legitimate
civil au thority, which has its
origin in God for the sake of the
common good and the order of
society (1 897). The fourth
commandment obliges children to
obey their parents (2216).
(2) Obedience offaith: The first
obedience is that of faith: to listen
and freely submit to the word of
God (144). (3) Obedience of Christ:
Jesus Christ substituted his
obedience to the will of his Father,
even unto death, for the diso­
bedience of sin, in order to bring
us the grace of justification and to
satisfy for our sins (615). (4) Vow
of obedience: In imitation of this
obedience of Jesus, as an evan­
gelical counsel, the faithful may
profess a vow of obedience; a
public vow of obedience, accepted
by Church authority, is one
element that characterizes the
consecrated life (915).

OIKONOMIA: See Economy.
OLD COVENANT: The old
dispensation or order, which God
established with his chosen
people Israel, through the reve­
lation of the Law to Moses (1961).
See Covenant.
OLD TESTAMENT: The forty-six
books of the Bible, which record
the history of salvation from
creation through the old alliance
or covenant with Israel, in pre­
paration for the appearance of
Christ as Savior of the world
(120-1). See Bible; Covenant.
ORDERS, HOLY: The Sacrament
of Apostolic Ministry by which
the mission entrusted by Christ to
his Apostles continues to be exer­
cised in the Church through the
laying on of hands. This

Glossa ry
sacrament has three distinct
degrees or "orders": deacon,
priest, and bishop. All three
confer a permanent, sacramenta l
character (1536).

ORDERS, RELIGIOUS:
See Consecrated Life; Institute,
Religious.

ORDINATION: The rite of the
Sacrament of Holy Orders by
which the bishop, through the
imposition of hands and the
prayer of consecration, confers the
order of b ishop, priest, or deacon
to exercise a sacred power which
comes from Christ on behalf of
the Church (1 538).
ORIGINAL SIN: The sin by
which the first human beings
disobeyed the commandment of
God, choosing to follow their own
will rather than God's will. As a
consequence they lost the grace o f
original holiness, and became
subject to the law of death; sin
became universally present in the
world. Besides the personal sin of
Adam and Eve, original sin des­
cribes the fallen state of human
nature which affects every person
born into the world, and from
which Christ, the "new Adam,"
came to redeem us (396-412).
ORTHODOX CHURCHES:
Eastern Churches not in full
communion with the Catholic
Church. Christians of the Ortho­
dox Churches are separated from
the Catholic Church (schism), yet
are in an imperfect but deep com­
munion with the Catholic Church
by reason of our common Bap­
tism, the profession of the Creed,
and the possession of true sacra­
ments by reason of the apostolic
succession of their priesthood

(838, 1399).

PAPACY: The supreme juris­
diction and ministry of the Pope
as shepherd of the whole Church.
As successor of St. Peter, and
therefore Bishop of Rome and
Vicar of Christ, the Pope is the
perpetual and visible principle of
unity in faith and communion in
the Church (882). See Pope.

PARABLES: A characteristic
feature of the teaching of Jesus.
Parables are simple images or
comparisons which confront the
hearer or reader with a radical
choice about his invitation to
enter the Kingdom of God (546).
P ARACLETE: A name for the
Holy Spirit. The term was used by
Jesus in the New Testament (cf. Jn
14:16) to indicate the promised
gift of the Spirit as another con­
soler and advocate, who would
continue his own mission among
the disciples (692).

PARADISE: The symbolic des­
cription of the condition of our
first parents before the Fall, who
lived in a state of friendship with
God in the happiness of original
justice and holiness (374, 384).
Paradise also signifies heaven, the
state of those who live with Christ
forever in the friendship and
presence of God (1023, 1 721).

PARISH: A stable community of
the faithful within a particular
church or diocese, whose pastoral
care is confided by the bishop to a

when history and all creation will
achieve their fulfillment (1001;
cf. 668, 673).

PARTICUL AR CHURCH:

PASCH/PASCHAL LAMB: Jesus'
saving death and its memorial in
the Eucharist, associated with the
Jewish feast of Passover (or
Pasch) commemorating the deli­
verance of the Jewish people
from death by the blood of the
lamb sprinkled on the doorposts
in Egypt, which the angel of
death saw and "passed over. "
Hence Jesus is acknowledged i n
the New Testament a s the Lamb
of God, who takes away the sins
of the world; he is the Paschal
Lamb, the symbol of Israel's
redemption at the first Passover.
The Eucharist celebrates the new
Passover, in which Jesus "passes
o ver" to his Father by his death
and resurrection, thus antici­
pating the final Passover of the
Church in the glory of the kingdom

(571, 608, 671, 1 334-1340).
PASCHAL MYSTERY/
SACRIFICE: Christ's work of
redemption accomplished prin­
cipally by his Passion, death,
Resurrection, and glorious
Ascension, whereby "dying he
destroyed our death, rising he
restored our life" (1067; cf. 654).
The paschal mystery is celebrated
and made present in the liturgy o f
the Church, a n d i t s saving effects
are communicated through the
sacraments (1076), especially the
Eucharist, which renews the
paschal sacrifice of Christ as the
sacrifice offered by the Church

(571, 1362-1372).

P ASSIGNS, MORAL:
The emotions or dispositions
which incline us to good or evil
actions, such as love and hate,
hope and fear, joy and sadness,
and anger (1763).

PASSOVER: See Pasch/ Paschal
Lamb .

PASTOR/PASTORAL OFFICE:
The ministry of shepherding the
faithful in the name of Christ.
The Pope and bishops receive the
pastoral office which they are to
exercise with Christ the Good
Shepherd as their model; they
share their pastoral ministry with
priests, to whom they give
responsibility over a portion o f
t h e flock a s pastors of parishes

(886, 1560, 2179).
PATRIARCH: A title given to the
venerable ancestors or " fathers"
of the Semitic peoples, Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, who received
God's promise of election (61,
205). In the Church hierarchy, and
especially among the Churches of
the East, a pa triarch is a senior
bishop with jurisdiction over a
larger unit of particular churches
(patriarchate) of a certain rite or
region or liturgical tradition (887).
PATRISTIC: Pertaining to the
writings of the holy Fathers of the
Church, who are privileged
witnesses of the apostolic tradi­
tion (78, 688). See Fathers of the
Church.

PEACE: One of the fru its of the
Holy Spirit mentioned in Ga la­
tians 5:22-23 (736). Peace is a goal
of Christian living, as indicated by
Jesus who said "Blessed are the
peacemakers, for they shall be
called children of God" ( 1 716).
The Fifth Commandment requires
us to preserve and work for peace,
which was defined by St. Augus­
tine as "the tranquility of order,"
and which is the work of justice
and the effect of cha rity (2304).
PENANCE: Interior penance: a
conversion of heart toward God
and away from sin, which implies
the intention to change one's life
because of hope in divine mercy
(1431). External acts of penance
include fasting, prayer, and alms­
giving (1434). The observance of
certain penitential practices is
obliged by the fourth precept of
the Church (2043).

PENANCE, SACRAMENT OF:
The liturgical celebration of God's
forgiveness of the sins of the peni­
tent, who is thus reconciled with
God and with the Church. The
acts of the penitent- contrition,
the confession of sins, and
satisfaction or reparation­
together with the prayer of abso­
lution by the priest, constitute the
essential elements of the Sacra­
ment of Penance (980, 1422, 1440,

1448).
PENITENT/PENITENTIAL: The
sinner who repents of sin and
seeks forgiveness (1451 ). In the
early Church, public sinners
belonged to an "order of peni­
tents," who did public penance
for their sins, often for years
(1447). Penitential acts or practices
refer to those which dispose one
for or flows from interior penance
or conversion; such acts lead to

PERSON, HUMAN: The human

PENTECOST: The "fiftieth" day
at the end of the seven weeks
following Passover (Easter in the
Christian dispensation). At the
first Pentecost after the Resur­
rection and Ascension of Jesus,
the Holy Spirit was manifested,
given and communicated as a
divine Person to the Church,
fulfilling the paschal mystery of
Christ according to his promise
(726, 731; cf. 1 287). Annually the
Church celebrates the memory of
the Pentecost event as the
beginning of the new "age of the
Church," when Christ lives and
acts in and with his Church (1076).
PEOPLE OF GOD: A synonym
for the Church, taken from the
Old Testament people whom God
chose, Israel. Christ instituted the
new and eternal covenant by
which a new priestly, prophetic,
and royal People of God, the
Church, participates in these
offices of Christ and in the mis­
sion and service which flow from
them (761, 783).
PERJURY: Giving one's word
under oath falsely, or making a
promise under oath without
intending to keep it. Perjury
violates the second and eighth
commandments (21 52, 2476).
PERSON, DIVINE: Hypostasis in
Greek; the term used to describe
the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in
their real relation to and distinc­
tion from one another within the

individual, made in the image of
God; not some thing but some
one, a unity of spirit and matter,
soul and body, capable of knowl­
edge, self-possession, and free­
dom, who can enter into com­
munion with other persons-and
with God (357, 362; cf. 1 700). The
human person needs to live in
society, which is a group of per­
sons bound together organically
by a principle of unity that goes
beyond each one of them (1879).

PETER (SAINT): Simon, whom
Jesus called Peter or "Rock," upon
whom he would build his Church
(Mt 1 6:16-19). He was the first to
confess Jesus to be the Christ, the
Son of the living God (442). He
was the first among the Apostles,
and their head; the Pope is his
successor as Bishop of Rome and
Vicar of Christ, and as pastor of
the universal Church (552 ff.; 765,
862, 881).
PIETY: One o f the seven gifts o f
the Holy Spirit which leads one t o
devotion t o God (1831). Filial
piety connotes an a ttitude of
reverence and respect by children
toward their parents (2215). Piety
also refers to the religious sense o f
a people, and its expression i n
popular devotions (1 674).

POLYGAMY: The practice of
having more than one wife at the
same time, which is contrary to
the unity of marriage between one
man and one woman, and which
offends against the d ignity of
woman (1645, 2387).
POPE: The successor of St. Peter
as Bishop of Rome and Supreme

894
Pontiff of the universal Catholic
Church. The Pope exercises a
primacy of authority as Vicar of
Christ and shepherd of the whole
Church; he receives the divine
assistance promised by Christ to
the Church when he defines
infallibly a doctrine of faith or
morals (880-882). See Papacy.

POVERTY: The condition of want
experienced by those who are
poor, whom Christ called
"blessed," and for whom he had a
special love (544). In imitation of
Christ, the Church expresses her
concern for the poor by working
for justice and solidarity (2443).
Poverty is one of the three evan­
gelical counsels whose public
profession in the Church is a
constitutive element of con­
secrated life (915). Poverty of
spirit signifies detachment from
worldly things and voluntary
humility (2544-46).
PRAISE: The form of prayer
which focuses on giving recog­
nition to God for his own sake,
giving glory to Him for who he is
(2639). In the liturgy of the Euch­
arist, the whole Church joins with
Christ i n giving praise and
thanksgiving to the Father (1358).
See Doxology.
PRAYER: The elevation of the
mind and heart to God in praise
of his glory; a petition made to
God for some desired good, or in
thanksgiving for a good received,
or in intercession for others before
God. Through prayer the Chris­
tian experiences a communion
with God through Christ in the
Church (2559-2565).
PRECEPTS OF THE CHURCH:
Positive laws (sometimes called
commandments) made by Church

Glossa ry
au thorities to guarantee for the
faithful the indispensable mini­
mum in prayer and moral effort,
for the sake of their growth in
love of God and neighbor (2041).

PRES BYTER: An "elder" or
priest, a member of the order of
priesthood; the presbyterate is one
of the three degrees of the Sacra­
ment of Holy Orders (1 536, 1554).
Presbyters or priests are co­
workers with their bishops and
form a unique sacerdotal college
or "presbyterium" dedicated to
assist their bishops in priestly
service to the People of God
(1567). Through the ministry of
priests, the unique sacrifice of
Christ on the cross is made
present in the Eucharistic sacrifice
of the Church (1554, 1562). See
Priesthood.
PRESENTATION: The
presentation and dedication of
Jesus to God by Mary and Joseph
in the Temple (Lk 2:22-39), in
accord with Mosaic Law con­
cerning the first-born. At the
Presentation, Simeon and Anna
sum up the expectation of Israel
for the long-awaited Messiah, the
light of the nations and the glory
of Israel, but also as a sign of
contradiction (529). The presen­
tation of the gifts, especially of
bread and wine, is a preparatory
rite for the liturgy of the Eucharist
at Mass (1346).
PRESUMPTION: An act or
attitude opposed to the theo­
logical virtue of hope. Presump­
tion can take the form of trust in
self without recognizing that
salvation comes from God, or of
an over-confidence in divine
mercy (2092).

PRIDE: One of the seven capital
sins. Pride is undue self-esteem or
self-love, which seeks attention
and honor and sets oneself in
competition with God (1 866) .
PRIESTHOOD: (1) Of the faithful:
The priestly people of God. Christ
has made of his Church a "king­
dom of priests," and gives the
faithful a sha re in his priesthood
through the Sacraments of
Baptism and Confirma tion (784,
1 1 19, 1546) . (2) Ministerial: The
ministerial priesthood received in
the Sacrament of Holy Orders
differs in essence from this com­
mon priesthood of all the faithful.
It has as its purpose to serve the
priesthood of all the faithful by
building up and guiding the
Church in the name of Christ,
who is Head of the Body (1547).
See Priesthood of Christ; Presbyter.

PRIESTHOOD OF CHRIST: The
unique high priest, according to
the order of Melchizedek. Christ
fulfilled everything that the
priesthood of the Old Covenant
prefigured. (d. Heb 5:10, 6:20). He
offered himself once and for all
(Heb 10: 14), in a perfect sacrifice
upon the cross. His priesthood is
made present in a special way
in the Church through the
ministerial priesthood, conferred
through the Sacrament of Holy
Orders (1 539, 1544, 1547, 1554).
PRIMACY: See Pope.
PRIVATE REVELATIONS:
Revelations made in the course of
history which do not add to or
form part of the deposit of faith,
but rather may help people live
out their faith more fully (67).
Some of these private revelations
have been recognized by the
authority of the Church, which

cannot accept so-called "revela­
tions of faith" that claim to
surpass or correct the Revela tion
of Christ confided to his Church.

PROFESSION OF FAITH: The
synthesis (creed, "symbol of
faith") of the faith which sum­
marizes the faith professed by
Christians (187). See Creed.
PROPHET: One sent by God to
form the people of the Old Cove­
nant in the hope of salvation. The
prophets are often au thors of
books of the Old Testament (702).
The prophetic books constitute a
major section of the Old Testa­
ment of the Bible (64, 120, 522,
2581). John the Baptist concludes
the work of the prophets of the
Old Covenant (721).
PROTESTANT: A person who
believes in Christ and has been
baptized, but who does not pro­
fess the Catholic faith in its
entirety, but rather is a member of
a P rotestant church or ecclesial
community whose roots are in the
Reformation, begun in the six­
teenth century (d. 838).
PROTO-EVANGELIUM: The
proto- or "first" Gospel: the pas­
sage in Genesis (3:15) that first
mysteriously announces the
promise of the Messiah and
Redeemer (410).
PROVIDENCE: The dispositions
by which God guides his creation
toward its perfection yet to be
attained; the protection and
governance of God over all
creation (302).
PRUDENCE: The virtue which

presence of Christ through adora­
tion and communion at the Euch­
aristic liturgy, and through ador­
ation outside its celebra tion

(2585).

(1378-9).

PS ALTER: The book of psalms
arranged for liturgical use (2587).

RECONCILIATION,
SACRAMENT OF: The

PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL: The
penalty for unrepented mortal sin,
separating the sinner from com­
munion with God for all eternity;
the condemnation of the unrepen­
tant sinner to hell (1035).

PUNISHMENT, TEMPORAL:
Purification of the unhealthy
attachment to creatures, which is
a consequence of sin that perdures
even after death. We must be
purified either during our earthly
life through prayer and a con­
version which comes from fervent
charity, or after death in pur­
gatory (1472).

PURGATORY: A state of final
purification after death and before
entrance into heaven for those
who died in God's friendship, but
were only imperfectly purified;
a final cleansing of human
imperfection before one is able
to enter the joy of heaven (1031;
cf. 1472).

RACISM: Unjust discrimination
on the basis of a person's race; a

sacramental celebration in which,
through God's mercy and forgive­
ness, the sinner is reconciled with
God and also with the Church,
Christ's Body, which is wounded
by sin (1422, 1442-5, 1468). See
Penance.

REDEEMER/REDEMPTION:
Jesus Christ, redeemer of man­
kind. Christ paid the price of his
own sacrificial death on the cross
to ransom us, to set us free from
the slavery of sin, thus achieving
our redemption. (571, 601; cf. 517,

1372) .
RELIGION: A set of beliefs and
practices followed by those com­
mitted to the service and worship
of God. The first commandment
requires us to believe in God, to
worship and serve him, as the
first duty of the virtue of religion

(2084, 2135).
RELI GIOUS LIFE:
See Consecrated Life.
REMISSION OF SINS: The
forgiveness of sins, which is
accomplished in us through faith
and Baptism, as the fruit of the
redemptive sacrifice of Christ on
the cross (976, 1 263). Christ gave

897

Glossary
the power to remit sins to his
Apostles, and through them to the
ministers of the Church (981). The
remission of sins committed after
Baptism is effected sacramentally
through the Sacrament of Penance
(or Reconciliation) (1446).

REPA RATION: Making amends
for a wrong done or for an
offense, especially for sin, which is
an offense against God. By his
death on the cross, the Son of God
offered his life out of love for the
Father to make reparation for our
sinful disobedience (614). We are
obliged to make reparation for
personal sins against justice and
truth, either through restitution of
stolen goods or correcting the
harm done to the other's good
name. (2412, 2487). See Satis­
faction (for sin).
REPENTANCE: See Contrition;
Penance.

RESTITUTI ON: The return of
what has been unjustly taken
from a nother (2409, 2412).
RESURRECTION OF CHRIST:
The bodily rising of Jesus from
the dead on the third day after his
death on the cross and burial in
the tomb. The resurrection of
Christ is the crowning truth of
our faith in Christ (638).

RESURRECTI ON OF THE
DEAD: The raising of the
righteous, who will live forever
with the risen Christ, on the last
day. The eleventh article of the
Christian creed states, "I believe
in the resurrection of the body."
The resurrection of the body
means not only that the immortal
soul will live on after death, but
that even our "mortal bodies"
(Rom 8:1 1 ) will come to life again

(988).

REVELATI ON: God's com­
munication of himself, by which
he makes known the mystery of
his divine plan, a gift of self­
communication which is realized
by deeds and words over time,
and most fu lly by sending us his
own divine Son, Jesus Christ (50).
RITES: The diverse liturgical
traditions in which the one cath­
olic and apostolic faith has come
to be expressed and celebrated in
various cultures and lands; for
example, in the West, the Roman
and Ambrosian (Latin) rites; in
the East, the Byzantine, Coptic
(Alexandrian), Syriac, Armenian,
Maronite, and Chaldean rites
(1201 -1203). "Rite" and "ritual"
are sometimes interchanged, as in
"the sacramental rite" or "the
sacramental ritual."
ROSARY: A prayer in honor of
the Blessed Virgin Mary, which
repeats the privileged Marian
prayer Ave Maria, or Hail Man;, in
"decades" of ten prayers, each
preceded by the Pater Noster
("Our Father") and concluded by
the Gloria Patri (Glory Be to the
Father), accompanied by medi­
tation on the mysteries of Christ's
life. The rosary was developed by
medieval piety in the Latin church
as a popular substitute for the
liturgical prayer of the Hours
(2678, 2708; cf. 1 674) .

SABBATH: The Sabbath or
seventh "day," on which God
rested after the work of the "six
days" of creation was completed,
as recounted in the opening nar­
rative of the Bible. Creation is thus
ordered to the Sabbath, the day to
be kept holy to the praise and
worship of God. Just as the

Glossa ry

898

seventh day or Sabba th completes
the first creation, so the "eighth
day," Sunday, the day of the week
on which Jesus rose from the
dead, is celebra ted as the "holy
day" by Christians-the day on
which the "new creation" began
(345-349) . Thus the Christian
observance of Sunday fulfills the
commandment to remember and
keep holy the Sabbath day (21 75).

SACRAMENT: An efficacious
sign of grace, instituted by Christ
and entrusted to the Church, by
which divine life is dispensed to
us through the work of the Holy
Spirit ( 1 1 31, 774) The sacraments
(called "mysteries" in the Eastern
Churches) are seven in number:
Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist,
Penance or Reconciliation,
Anointing of the Sick, Holy
Orders, and Matrimony (1210).
.

SACRAMENT ALS: Sacred signs
which bear a certain resemblance
to the sacraments, and by means
of which spiritual effects are sig­
nified and obtained through the
prayers of the Church (1667).
SACRED HEART: The symbol
of the love with which Jesus
continually loves the eternal
Father and all human beings
without exception (478).

SACRIFICE: A ritual offering
made to God by a priest on behalf
of the people, as a sign of adora­
tion, gratitude, supplication, and
communion (2099). The perfect
sacrifice was Christ's death on the
cross; by this sacrifice, Christ
accomplished our redemption as
high priest of the new and eternal
covenant (616). The sacrifice of
Christ on the cross is commem­
orated and mysteriously made

present in the Eucharistic sacrifice
of the Chu rch (1 357, 1 544).

SACRILEGE: Profanation of or
irreverence towa rd persons,
places, and things which are
sacred, i.e., dedicated to God;
sacrilege against the sacraments,
especially the Eucharist, is a
particularly grave offense against
the first commandment (2120).

SAINT: The "holy one" who
leads a life in union with God
through the grace of Christ and
receives the reward of eternal life.
The Church is called the
communion of saints, of the holy
ones (823, 946; cf. 828). See
Canonization.
SAL VATION: The forgiveness of
sins and restoration of friendship
with God, which can be done by
God alone (169).
SANCTIFYING GRACE:
The grace which heals our human
nature wounded by sin by giving
us a share in the divine life of the
Trinity. It is a habitual, super­
natural gift which continues the
work of sanctifying us-of
making us "perfect," holy, and
Christlike (1999).

SANCTUARY: {1) The part of a
church set apart for the principal
rites of worship (cf. 1 1 83). (2) A
shrine or place of pilgrimage

{1674).
SAT AN: A fallen angel or the
devil; the Evil One (391, 395, 2851).
SATISFACTION (FOR SIN):
An act whereby the sinner makes
amends for sin, especially in
reparation to God for offenses
against him. The penance given
by the confessor in the Sacrament
of Penance constitutes such

Glossa ry
satisfaction. All true satisfaction
for sin must be a participation in
the satisfaction for sin made by
Christ through his death on the
cross (1459). See Penance; Penitent/
Penitential; Reparation.

SAVIOR: Jesus (which means
"God saves" in Hebrew). The Son
of God became man to achieve
our salvation; he is the unique
savior of humanity (430).

SCANDAL: An attitude or
behavior which leads another to
do evil (2284).
SCHISM: Refusal of submission
to the Supreme Pontiff, or of com­
munion with the members of the
Church subject to him (2089).
SCRIPTURE, SACRED:
The sacred writings of the Old
and New Testaments (101). See
Bible.

SEAL OF CONFESSION:
The confessor's obligation to keep
absolutely secret what a penitent
has told to him in the Sacrament
of Penance; also known as the
"sacramental seal" (1467).

SECOND COMING OF
CHRIST: See Parousia.
SECULAR INSTITUTE:
See Institute, Secular.
SENSUS FIDEI: A supernatural
appreciation of the faith (sensus
fidei) shown by the universal
consent in matters of faith and
morals manifested by the whole
body of the faithful under the
guidance of the Magisterium (92).
SEPTUAGINT: A pre-Christian
Greek translation of the Hebrew
Scriptures made by Jewish

899

scholars, and la ter adopted by
Greek-speaking Christians (213).

SIGN OF THE CROSS: A sign in
the form of a cross made by the
Christian as a prayer honoring the
Blessed Trinity, "in the name of
the Father and of the Son and of
the Holy Spirit" (21 57; cf. 786).
SIMONY: The buying or selling
of spiritual things, which have
God alone as their owner and
master (2121).
SIN: An offense against God as
well as a fault against reason,
truth, and right conscience. Sin
is a deliberate thought, word,
deed, or omission contrary to the
eternal law of God. In judging the
gravity of sin, it is customary to
distinguish between mortal and
venial sins (1849, 1 853, 1 854).
SLANDER: See Calumny.
SLOTH: A culpable lack of
physical or spiritual effort; acedia
or laziness. One of the capital sins
(1866, 2094, 2733).
SOCIAL JUSTICE: The respect
for the human person and the
rights which flow from human
dignity and guarantee it. Society
must provide the conditions that
allow people to obtain what is
their due, according to their
nature and vocation (1928, 1931).
SOCIAL SIN: The effect of sin
over time, which can affect society
and its institutions to create
"structures of sin," by analogy
called "social sin" (1869).
SOCIAL TEACHING: The
teaching (social doctrine) of the
Church on the truth of revelation
about human dignity, human
solidarity, and the principles of

900

justice and peace; the moral
judgments about economic and
social matters requ ired by such
truth and about the demands of
justice and peace (241 9-2422).

SON OF GOD: A title frequently
applied to Jesus in the Gospel,
signifying his unique relationship
to the Father. The second Person
of the Blessed Trinity is called Son
of God in reference to the Eternal
Father. The revelation of his
divine sonship is the principal
dramatic development of the
story of Jesus of Nazareth

(441-445).
SON OF MAN: The title used by
our Lord of himself in the Gospel.
This title connotes a relationship
with the eschatological figure of
the "Son of man appearing in
clouds and glory" in the prophecy
of Daniel (Mk 1 3:26; On 7:13) (440;
cf. 661 ).

SOUL: The spiritual principle of
human beings. The soul is the
subject of human consciousness
and freedom; soul and body
together form one unique human
nature. Each human soul is
individual and immortal, imme­
diately created by God. The soul
does not die with the body, from
which it is separated by death,
and with which it will be reunited
in the final resurrection (363, 366;
cf. 1703).

SPIRIT: See Holy Spirit.
STEALINGffH EFT: Unjustly
taking and keeping the property
of another, against the reasonable
will of the owner (2408). Stealing
is a violation of the seventh
commandment of God, "Thou
shalt not steal . "

Glossa ry
SUICIDE: The willful ta king of
one's own life; a grievous sin
against the fifth commandment. A
human person is neither the
au thor nor the supreme arbiter of
his life, of which God is sovereign
master (2280).
SUN DAY: The "Lord's Day," the
principal day of the week for the
Eucharistic celebration of the
Church. Each Sunday Mass com­
memorates the resurrection of
Christ on the first Easter Sunday,
and is a reminder of the first day
of creation for those who have
become a "new creation in Christ"

( 1 1 66, 2174, 2180).
SUPERNATURAL: Surpassing
the power of created beings; a
result of God's gracious initiative.
Our vocation to eternal life is
supernatural (1 998; cf. 1 722).

SUPERSTITION: The attribution
of a kind of magical power to cer­
tain practices or objects, like
charms or omens. Reliance on
such power, rather than on trust
in God, constitutes an offense
against the honor due to God
alone, as required by the first
commandment (21 10).
SYNOD: A meeting of bishops of
an ecclesiastical province or
patriarchate (or even from the
whole world, e.g., Synod of
Bishops) to discuss the doctrinal
and pastoral needs of the church.
A diocesan synod is an assembly of
priests and other members of
Christ's faithful who assist the
bishop by offering advice about
the needs of the diocese and by
proposing legislation for him to
enact (887, 911). The words
"synod" and "council" are some­
times used interchangeably.

TABERNACLE: The receptacle in
the church in which the conse­
crated Eucharist is reserved for
Communion for the sick and
dying. Reservation of the Euch­
arist in the tabernacle lends itself
to private devotional visits and
adoration of our Lord in the
Blessed Sacrament by the faithful

( 1 1 83, 1 379).
TEACHING OFFICE: See
Magisterium.

TEMPERANCE: The cardinal
moral virtue that moderates the
attraction of pleasure and pro­
vides balance in the use of created
goods. It ensures the mastery of
the will over instinct, and keeps
natural desires within proper
limits (1 809).

TEMPLE: The house of worship
built in Jerusalem by Solomon as
God's dwelling-place, for the
exercise of the priestly rites of
sacrifice in the Jewish religion.
After the capture of Jerusalem in
70 AD. by the Romans, the second
temple was destroyed and never
rebuilt. Jesus recognized the
Temple as God's dwelling, and a
house of prayer; he even iden­
tified himself with the Temple by
presenting himself as God's
definitive dwelling-place. The
Holy Spirit makes the Church
" the temple of the living God"
(583, 797; cf. 2580) .
TEMPTATION: An attraction

'
either from outside oneself or
from within, to act contrary
to right reason and the com­
mandments of God. Jesus him­
self during his life on earth was
tempted, put to the test, to
manifest both the opposition

between himself and the devil and
the triumph of his saving work
over Satan (538).

TESTAMENT: The name given to
the two major parts of the Bible; a
synonym for "covenant," as in
Old and New Covenants. The Old
Testament recounts the history of
salvation before the time of Christ
(46 books), and the New Testa­
ment unfolds the saving work of
Jesus and the apostolic beginnings
of the Church (27 books) (120-1,
124). See Covenant.

THEOLOGY: The study of God,
based on divine revelation (236,

2033, 2038).
THEOPHANY: A revelation or
visible appearance of God, as in
the case of Moses at Mount Sinai

(2059).
TIME: See Eternal Life.
TRADITION: The living trans­
mission of the message of the
Gospel in the Church. The oral
preaching of the Apostles, and the
written message of salvation
under the inspiration of the Holy
Spirit (Bible), are conserved and
handed on as the deposit of faith
through the apostolic succession
in the Church. Both the living
Tradition and the written Scrip­
tures have their common source
in the revelation of God in Jesus
Christ (75-82). The theological,
liturgical, disciplinary, and devo­
tional traditions of the local
churches both contain and can be
distinguished from this apostolic
Tradition (83).

TRANSFIGURATION: The
mysterious event in which Jesus,
seen speaking with Moses and
Elijah on the mountain, was trans­
formed in appearance-in the

902

sight of Peter, James, and John
-as a moment of disclosure of his
divine glory (554).

TRANSUB STANTIATION: The
scholastic term used to designate
the unique change of the Euch­
aristic bread and wine into the
Body and Blood of Christ.
"Transubstantiation" indicates
that through the consecration of
the bread and the wine there
occurs the change of the entire
substance of the bread into the
substance of the Body of Christ,
and of the entire substance of the
wine into the blood of Christ­
even though the appearances or
"species" of bread and wine
remain (1376).

TRIDUUM: A liturgical cele­
bration of three days duration, as
in the Easter Triduum (1 168).

TRINITY: The mystery of one
God in three Persons: Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit. The revealed
truth of the Holy Trinity is at the
v� ry root of the Church's living
faith as expressed in the Creed.
The mystery of the Trinity in itself
is inaccessible to the human mind
and is the object of faith only
because it was revealed by Jesus
Christ, the divine Son of the eter­
nal Father (232, 237, 249, 253-6).
See Person, Divine.

TYPOLO GY: The discernment of
persons, events, or things in the
Old Testament which prefigured,
and thus served as a "type" (or
prototype) of, the fulfillment of
God's plan in the person of Christ.
The typology of the Old Testa­
ment which is made clear in the
New Testament demonstrates the
dynamic unity of the divine plan
of salvation (128).

Glossa ry
-UUNITY, CHRISTIAN:
See Ecumenism .

- VVENERATION (OF SAINTS):
Showing devotion and respect
to Mary, the Apostles, and the
martyrs, who were viewed as
faithful witnesses to faith in Jesus
Christ. Later, veneration was
given to those who led a life of
prayer and self-denial in giving
witness to Christ, whose virtues
were recognized and publicly
proclaimed in their canonization
as saints (828). Such veneration is
often extended to the relics or
remains of those recognized as
saints; indeed, to many sacred
objects and images. Veneration
must be clearly distinguished
from adoration and worship,
which are due to God alone ( 1 1 54,

1674, 2132).
VENIAL SIN: Sin which does not
destroy the divine life in the soul,
as does mortal sin, though it
diminishes and wounds it (1 855).
Venial sin is the failure to observe
necessary moderation, in lesser
matters of the moral law, or in
grave matters acting without full
knowledge or complete consent

(1 862).
VIATICUM: The Eucharist
received by a dying person. It is the
spiritual food for one's "passing
over" to the Father from this world.
With Penance and the Anointing of
the Sick, the reception of Holy
Communion as Viaticum constitute
the "last sacraments" of the
Christian (1524).

VICAR OF CHRIST: A title given
to St. Peter, head of the Twelve

903

Glossary

VICE: A habit acquired by
repeated sin in violation of the
proper norms of human morality.
The vices are often linked with the
seven capital sins. Repentance for
sin and confession may restore
grace to a soul, but the removal of
the ingrained disposition to sin or
vice requires much effort and
self-denial, until the contrary
virtue is acquired (1 866).

hereafter. God has created the
human person to love and serve
him; the fulfillment of this
vocation is eterna l happiness
(1, 358, 1 700). Christ calls the
faithful to the perfection of
holiness (825) . The voca tion of
the laity consists in seeking the
kingdom of God by engaging in
temporal affairs and directing
them according to God's will
(898). Priestly and religious
vocations are dedicated to the
service of the Church as the
universal sacrament of salvation
(d. 873; 931 ).

VIRGIN BIRTH: The conception

Mary solely by the power of the
Holy Spirit. The Church's con­
fession of faith in the virgin birth
affirms that Jesus was conceived
by the Holy Spirit without human
seed (496). See Virgin Mary.

VIRGIN MARY: The mother of
Jesus, who is honored as "ever­
virgin" for her perpetual virginity

promise made to God, concerning
a possible and better good which
must be fulfilled by reason of the
virtue of religion (2102). Religious
vows, the public profession of
the evangelical counsels in the
Church, have an exemplary value
in witnessing to the kingdom to
come (d. 915).

VIRTUE: An habitual and firm
disposition to do the good . The
moral virtues are acquired
through human effort aided by
God's grace; the theological vir­
tues are gifts of God (1803). See
Cardinal Virtues.

VIRTUES, THEOLOGICAL:
Gifts infused by God into the
souls of the faithful to make them
capable of acting as his children
and of meriting eternal life. The
theological virtues are faith, hope,
and charity (1813).

WAY OF THE CROSS:
A devotional exercise which
follows the "way of the cross"
in the Savior's steps, observing
stops or "stations" to meditate
on the path Jesus took from the
Praetorium in Jerusalem to
Golgotha and the tomb. "By his
holy Cross he has redeemed the
world" (2669).

WISDOM: A spiritual gift which
enables one to know the purpose
and plan of God; one of the seven
gifts of the Holy Spirit (1831).
Wisdom is also the name of one of
the books of the Old Testament

Vision.

(120).

VOCATI ON: The calling or
destiny we have in this life and

WORD OF GOD: The entire
content of revelation as contained

904

in the Holy Bible and procla imed
in the Church. In John's Gospel,
God's "Word" means his only­
begotten Son, who is the fullness
of God's revelation and who took
flesh (the Word incarnate) and
became man for the sake of our
salvation (65, 81, 101, 24 1, 461; cf.

2653).
WORKS OF MERCY: Charitable
actions by which we come to the
aid of our neighbors in their
bodily and spiritual needs (2447).
The spiritual works of mercy
include instructing, advising,
consoling, comforting, forgiving,
and patiently forbearing. Corporal
works of mercy include feeding
the hungry, clothing the naked,
visiting the sick and imprisoned,
sheltering the homeless, and
burying the dead (2447).

WORLD: Creation, or the earth,
or even the universe. "All that is"
-often called the "world" in
Scriptur e-owes its existence to
God's act of creation; God's
creation is called "good" in the
Bible, and human beings are said

Glossary
to have been created "in his own
image and likeness" (282, 295). In
the New Testament the "world" is
sometimes used to indicate the
forces of opposition to the work of
Jesus and of his Holy Spirit. In
this sense it signifies the world
which Jesus came to redeem from
sin. The world will reach its goal
and perfection when it has been
renewed and transformed into
"the new heaven and the new
earth" in the fullness of God's
kingdom (1043).

WORSHIP: Adoration and honor
given to God, which is the first act
of the virtue of religion (2096).
Public worship is given to God in
the Church by the celebration of
the Paschal Mystery of Christ in
the liturgy (1067).

- YYAHWEH (YHWH): The per­
sonal name of the God of Israel,
revealed to Moses on Mt. Sinai,
meaning "I am who I am" (205).
